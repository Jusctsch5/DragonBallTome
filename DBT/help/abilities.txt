[[[[[BAbilities Overview]                                                      
Dragonball T features nearly thirty abilities. However, you only begin the     
game aware of three of them, and will need to learn others as you progress     
through the game. The following is a list of the 'standard' abilities. Chi     
abillities are 'secret' and will need to be discovered.                        
                                                                               
#####GAcupuncture                                                              
        Allows use of acupuncture needles to restore yourself to health.       
                                                                               
#####GBlocking                                                                 
        With blocking, barehanded fighters will gain an armor class bonus      
equal to their barehand skill for every hand they have available. For          
example, with 40 barehand, and both hands empty, blocking would provide a      
+80 bonus to AC. Wielding a flashlight in one hand (via the Double Attack      
ability) would leave only one hand free, and thus the AC bonus would be        
+40.                                                                           
                                                                               
#####GBleed Attack                                                             
        In the hands of a weapons fighter with knowledge of this attack,       
all bladed weapons will be treated as if they were Vorpal blades, thus         
allowing their wielder to cut his oppoenents, and cause them to bleed          
over time. Additionally, the effectiveness of genuinely vorpal weapons         
will be doubled for those with this ability.                                   
                                                                               
#####GDouble Attack                                                            
        Allows a barehanded fighter to use both of his hands individually.     
If both hands are empty, he will receive two attacks, or he may equip an       
item (such as a flashlight) in one hand, and still attack normally with the    
other.                                                                         
                                                                               
#####GJump                                                                     
        Allows you to jump two squares in any direction, bypassing terrain     
in the in-between square.                                                      
                                                                               
#####GIaijutsu                                                                 
        Allows you to equip and take-off melee weapons and small firearms      
in zero time, and using no energy. Note that bazookas will still take time     
to equip and remove.                                                           
                                                                               
#####GImmovability                                                             
        Ability to resist being moved. Once learned, immovability is           
accessed via the 'S'et movement mode command.                                  
                                                                               
#####GMartial Arts Sushi Eating Technique!                                     
        Ability to eat with such amazing speed that your motion will be        
completely undetectable, and consume virtually no time!                        
                                                                               
#####GMeditation                                                               
        Once learned, this ability will increase the rate at which you         
regenerate spent chi.                                                          
                                                                               
#####GMotorcycle Riding                                                        
                                                                               
        Ability to ride motorcycles. While riding, you will move *FAST*,       
but you will be unable to perform many actions, such as opening doors,         
goign up or down stairs, and fighting.                                         
                                                                               
#####GMulti Target Tracking                                                    
        When fighting with paried guns, this ability allows you to fire        
on multiple, separate targets with each one. Very useful, but can be           
annoying to be constantly prompted. This ability can be enabled/disabled       
from the '=' options screen.                                                   
                                                                               
#####GPaired Weapons                                                           
        Allows you to fight 'florentine' with two weapons simultaneously.      
One in each hand. Note that fighting with two weapons can be tremendously      
difficult if the weapons in question are not naturally pairable. You'll        
be able to do it, but the regular weapon difficulty penalties will be          
multiplied, and applied to each weapon. Net penalties can range anywhere       
from -1 to -192. Pay careful attention to weapon pairings when using           
mismatched weapons.                                                            
                                                                               
#####GPaired Firearms                                                          
        Allows you to fight with two guns simultaneously. One in each hand.    
Paired firearm penalties are ALWAYS multiplied. There are no naturally         
pairing firearms.                                                              
                                                                               
#####GPoint Blank Firing                                                       
        Allows you to fire at point blank range, using the direction keys      
to fight adjacent monsters instead of having to engage the 'f'ire command.     
                                                                               
#####GRiposte                                                                  
        Allows you to a chance to attempt a counterattack on any monster       
who succesfully lands a blow on you. To riposte, you must not be blind,        
confused, or hallucinating, the monster must be visble, and you must have      
a suitable weapon. You may only riposte with a single weapon. If you are       
wielding two weapons, the one in the left hand will be used for the strike.    
For every succesful blow landed on you by a monster, your base chance to       
riposte will be 20%, plus your character level, and minus the monster level.   
For example, a level 20 character would have a 28% chance to riposte on        
every attack of a level 12 foot ninja, but only a 8% to riposte an attack      
from Krillan, at level 32.                                                     
                                                                               
#####GSkating                                                                  
        Ability to use in-line skates. Skates will increase your movement      
speed, but you will also be easier to knock down.                              
                                                                               
#####GSwimming                                                                 
        Ability to swim through water too deep to wade through.                
                                                                               
#####GTameshiwari                                                              
        The art of breaking boards, bricks, and other objects. With a          
high enough barehanded skill, this ability allows the character to travel      
through doors, trees, and eventually even solid stone.                         
                                                                               
#####GThrow                                                                    
        Ability to pick up a monster up and throw them somewhere nearby.       
                                                                               
#####GUltimate Fighting                                                        
        Allows use of ALL weapons, firearms and barehanded fighting            
methods completely interchangably.
