        Quaff, or 'drink' a liquid. Dragonball T does not feature 'potions'    
        in the traditional roguelike sense, but there are some item types      
        which may be drunk.

        in parchment form. Technomancers may also attempt to learn recipes     
        by reading blueprints. Note that you will need light to read by.

        Search the immediate area for traps or secret doors.

        To use/activate any item, tool, or artifact. In Dragonball T, the      
        'u'se command unifies most Angband style aim/zap/use/apply/activate    
        commands, except for 'r'ead and 'q'uaff.

        Give an item to someone. This is only occasionally used. Most          
        'give' type actions will be accessed through dialoqgue, however,       
        occassionally this command will be useful. For example, you may        
        give senzu beans to companions to heal them.

        Attempt to disarm a trap. Depends on the Disassembly skill.

        Refill anything that takes fuel, or batteries. Different item types    
        will require different fuel sources. Flashlights require batteries,    
        flame throwers require propane tanks, SCUBA gear requires oxygen       
        tanks, etc.

        previously gained levels. Dragonball T features a uniques skill/class  
        system, and it it highly recommended that you read through the related 
        help files.

        View a verbose object dscription for an item.                          
        NOTE: With the new inventory subsystem of alpha 11, this command is    
        no longer active. It will probably make a comeback once I'm able to    
        restore it. In the meantime, access verbose descriptions via the       
        inventory command.

        Permanently retire the character. Equivalent to dying.

        Causes time to go by rapidly to allow you to regain health and chi.    
        Your rest may be interupted, but this is much safer than holding down  
        keys to pass time.
