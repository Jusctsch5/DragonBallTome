#####GQ. This game is way too hard!                                            
                                                                               
A. Dragonball T is total conversion module. Lots of things work differently    
from the ToME module, there are a lot of new things to do, and new things      
to know. Once you get past the learning curve, I think you'll find that it     
isn't as difficult as it ay seem at first. In fact, there are a lot of little  
tricks that can make even the early game very easy. You just have to find      
out what they are.

#####GQ. How can I make the early game easier?                                 
                                                                               
A. Most of these problems come from initial stat point allocation and          
choice of school. If you start with a charisma of 8, and try to play           
a Barehanded fighter, you're going to have a VERY hard time of things.         
Here's a simple recipe for an easy start:                                      
                                                                               
 1)  Start a new character with 12 charisma (And thus, 1000 zeni)              
 2)  Press 'S' and change to movement mode 'd' 'Running                        
 3)  Stop by the Megamall '1' and buy a flashlight                             
 4)  If you are planning on dungeon delving, then you need a one               
     handed weapon so you can wield your flashlight at the same time.          
     Head north, past the World Tournament building off the edge               
     of the map, and find the Martial Arts Supply Store '3'. Buy a             
     a one handed weapon, like sai, tonfa, nunchaku or an escrima              
     stick.                                                                    
 5)  Hunt white belts in town, and you should be able to make level            
     three in a few minutes.                                                   
 6)  Pick a style. Karate and Kungfu are both good choices for a               
     beginner. Both may be found directly south of the World Tournament        
     building near where you started. Look for the '4's. Enroll in some        
     basic classes. In particular, martial arts, and either weapons            
     or barehanded, depending on which sort of fighter you'd prefer to         
     play. Weapons fighters are easier for new players.                        
 7)  Follow the road west from the Karate school to Aru village. The           
     villagers there are having a number of problems you may be able           
     to help with.                                                             
 8)  There is a Rabbit Hole in the woods west of Aru. Perhaps the Rabbit       
     Imelda speaks of is in there?                                             
                                                                               
~~~~~4                                                                         
#####GQ. Does it matter which gender I play?                                   
                                                                               
A. Yes. Gender significantly affects a number of things, including:            
                                                                               
 * Available schools                                                           
 * Dialogue options                                                            
 * Access to certain quests                                                    
 * Equipment allowances                                                        
 * Marriage options

#####GQ. I don't really need to waste points in charisma, do I?                
                                                                               
A. Skimping on charisma is not recommended. As a measure of how good           
ou are with people, charisma will affect which dialogue responses you're       
able to choose from. And time you see an option marked (Persuade) this         
is an option that only exists for characters with a certain minimum of         
charisma. In particular, the various marriage options will generally           
only be available to characters with charisma of at least 15, and some         
dialogue options will require a charisma as high as 20 to gain access.         
                                                                               
~~~~~6                                                                         
#####GQ. What's the deal with the Martial Arts skill?                          
                                                                               
A. Stop thinking of it as solely a to-hit bonus. It is that, but it's          
also supposed to represent knowledge of martial arts as a whole. Students      
of a school which focuses exclusively on a single aspect of martial arts       
may know a lot about that aspect, but at the expense of everything else.       
A school which only teaches weapons, or only teaches barehanded fighting,      
for example, is right away cutting out an entire field of possible knowledge.  
Consequently, the more specialized the school, the less of a Martial Arts      
skill bonus it is likely to offer.                                             
                                                                               
~~~~~7                                                                         
#####GQ. The Chi skills are way too expensive and seriously underpowered!      
                                                                               
A. No, they aren't. Chi system is potentially game-shatteringly powerful.      
You just haven't learned how to use it effectively yet. It is, however,        
balanced heavily in favor of the end-game. Chi requires a high skill           
investment before it becomes very practical, and you will need to raise        
several Chi skills to moderate levels and learn some abilities before          
the system is likely to be of any value.                                       
                                                                               
 * Don't bother investing points until you can raise MULTIPLE Chi              
   skills. The Chi skills work cooperatively with one another, and             
   even an extremely high skill value in a single Chi skill, even 100,         
   will be worthless unless you have points in other Chi skills as well.       
                                                                               
 * Don't bother investing points until you have access to a Chi ability        
   that you want to use. Chi skills determine the operation of Chi             
   abilities. If you have no abilities, your skills won't be able to           
   do anything useful. Waiting will also prevent mis-investing of              
   points. For example, raising Chi defense to 100 is useless if your          
   only Chi ability is an offensive one.                                       
                                                                               
 * For instant effects, you'll generally need at least five points             
   in at least two or three Chi skills if you expect to see even a             
   modicum of usefulness from the ability. For constant effects,               
   it will be at least 10 points, and soemtimes as many as twenty              
   before the abilities become useful. To see the true power of                
   the Chi system, you'll need to invest a signifncant percentages             
   of your total allotted skill points. Fifty skill points worth               
   of Chi skills will be useful, but expect to spend well over a               
   hundred before you truly start to become powerful from it.                  
                                                                               
 * Be willing to micro manage your constant effects. Don't expect              
   to be able to turn everything on and just leave them on all the             
   time. Remember that there is no energy cost or delay associated             
   with changing your settings.                                                
                                                                               
 * If you're short on skill points, remember that point for point,             
   Intelligence is worth just as many Chi points as the Chi skill,             
   and there are twenty free Intelligence points available in the              
   game. With careful planning, it should theoretically be possible            
   to have 33 Chi available without ever spending a single skill               
   point in Intelligence, Willpower or Chi.                                    
                                                                               
 * You might consider reading through the spoilers for Chi.

A. There is much to be said either way. Both styles are extremely              
playable, and it's probably best to decide for aesthetic reasons               
rather than mechanical ones.

   * With twice as many skills directly relating to weapons combat             
     as barehanded, there are rarely enough skill points to go around          
   * Due to the mechanics of the combat skills, while weapons fighters         
     will be capable of having an armor class comparable to that of            
     a barehanded fighter, it will generally be more difficult and             
     more expensive to do so.                                                  
   * Optimizing skill point expenditures can become complicated                
   * Weapons fighters in the afterlife may be seriously handicapped            
     due to the inability to use any non-artifact weapons

   * With fewer combat skills to worry about, barehanded fighters will         
     generally have more skill points available to spend

     armor class                                                               
   * No need to ever worry about losing a weapon and being helpless.           
   * Barehanded fighters have a tremendously easier time in the                
     afterlife due to the lack of reliance on equipment

   * Lower damage potentials. Proper skill management will completely          
     alleviate this problem, but carelessness can lead to situations           
     in which, for example, a level 12 Barehanded fighter averages             
     about 11 damage per turn, whereas a weapons fighter can average           
     19 damage (even at level 1) with a store-bought weapon.

#####GQ. Which school should I study at?                                       
                                                                               
A. The enrollment system is rather complicated, but the simplest               
answer is to study at as small a variety of schools as possible to             
get the skill coverage that you want. Once you reach the maximum level         
of training for the 'primary' skill of any school, you'll be issued a          
quest to challenge the schools rival to a duel. Once you succeed, that         
school will close  and the training caps at the school that issued the         
quest will increase. Once the Challenge quest has been completed, every        
time you close any other school, the training caps will increase again.        
                                                                               
Note that because of the closures, it is not possible to study at both         
of any pair of rival schools. These are:                                       
                                                                               
 * Karate with Kickboxing                                                      
 * Kungfu with Fencing                                                         
 * Judo with Sumo                                                              
 * (As of V083: Ballet, TaeKwonDo, Ninjutsu and Marksmanship are 'pending')    
                                                                               
Again, the system is flexible, and skilled players will be able to             
devise all sorts of completely viable builds, but as a simple overview,        
in general you'll usually want:                                                
                                                                               
 * A fighting skill (barehanded or weapons, usually)                           
 * A source of hit points (con from Ballet or Sumo, usually)                   
 * A source of speed (speed from Judo, Kickboxing or fencing, or dexterity     
                      from Ballet or Kungfu...usually)                         
 * Useful abilities to complement your fighting style                          
 * A secondary source of to-hit bonuses                                        
                                                                               
For a barehanded fight, for example, any combination of Karate, Kickboxing,    
Judo and/or Sumo usually works pretty well. For a weapons fighter, you'll      
want to pick either Kungfu or Fencing, and then either Sumo or Ballet. But,    
again, lots of viable combinations exist. To gives some obious examples:       
                                                                               
Kickboxing + Sumo (The walking tank)                                           
Kickboxing gives access to Barehanded, Speed, and the extremely useful         
Double Attack ability, while Sumo gives terrific constitution and strength,    
for high hit points and damage. Absolutely devastating at early levels,        
but this build will suffer from poor to-hit odds and have a tough time         
identifying useful equipment.                                                  
                                                                               
Kungfu + Ballet (The unstoppable blade)                                        
Kungfu gives access to all the weapon skills, as well as the Paired Weapon     
ability. Ballet gives dexterity for good to hit and running speed bonuses,     
and constituion for lots of hit points. Since the running speed bonus maxes    
at +10, this build will suffer from a low maximum speed potential, and the     
lack of strength will limit the damage potential, but otherwise this pair      
should also do well. Especially by maxing martial arts, weapons and dexterity, 
this build should fairly easily be able to get a to-hit bonus in the +300      
range, at which point the low damage isn't such an issue.

A. Your available Chi pool is calculated as your Intelligence, plus your       
willpower, plus your Chi skill, minus 20. One point of Chi skill is only       
worth one point in your reserve pool if Int and Will are both 10. If you       
start the game with Int and Will both at 8, and never raise them, you'll       
have to raise your Chi skill to 5 before you'll get to see a single point      
of it. Try spending some time studying at the library. That should help        
increase your Intelligence.

A. Well, anytime you'd like, really. The matches start out quite easy,         
and become progressively more difficult, but even a level 1 character          
should be able to win the first two matches. Also, you'll be prompted          
before each match if you'd like to proceed, and you may freely leave           
for as long as you'd like between matches, with no penalty. Just be aware      
that the Tournament is televised world-wide, and the further you progrss       
in the Tournament, the more likely it is that people will recognize you        
outside the Tournament. That could be good. That could be bad. In particular   
once you've won the Tournament, instructors will no longer accept challenges   
from you. This can have a tremendous affect on your potential skills and       
abilties, so be careful aboit that.

A. Money is somewhat more rare and valuable in Dragonball T than it is         
in most other roguelikes. Here are some possible solutions:                    
                                                                               
 * Don't start the game with an 8 charimsa, for starters. Not only does        
   charisma determine starting money (which can range from 0 to 1000) it       
   also affects your buy/sell prices from stores, and the monetary value       
   of certain quest rewards                                                    
 * Both the Pawnshop, and R-Vac will buy items. R-Vac offers better prices     
   but the Pawnshop will buy anything.                                         
 * Be sure to identify things before you sell them. Unidentified items sell    
   for 1 zeni. You will need skill, or the ability to use a laptop to identify 
   things.                                                                     
 * Play a weapons fighter. Barehanded fighters generally have a more difficult 
   time identifying anything worth selling.                                    
 * Experiment with different items to see what is worth selling. Wine bottles, 
   for example, are fairly common even at low levels, and sell better than     
   many other items.                                                           
 * The prize for winning the World Tournament is a million zeni

#####GQ. I just killed so-and-so and he didn't drop a dragonball!              
                                                                               
(Note that this answer explains how the system is *intended* to work. It is    
 not functioning 100% as intended, yet.)                                       
                                                                               
A. Yes, that can happen. There are exactly seven dragonballs. No more!         
There are a few monsters who are 'gaurunteed' to drop dragonballs, but         
that gauruntee is completely contingent on a dragonball actually being         
available. It may or may not be! The most obvious example, of course, would    
be when you have all seven dragonballs in your possession. If you then kill    
a uniques that is 'gaurunteed' to drop one, the system will quickly check      
and see that there aren't any available dragonballs, and your unique will      
drop nothing. However, just because there are dragonballs you don't have       
doesn't mean that they're available. For instance, nearly every monster in     
the game has at least a 1:1000 chance of spawning with a dragonball on it.     
That's why you find them so often. Kill a few hundred monsters and you've      
a decent chance of finding a dragonball. But...for every dragonball you        
actually find on a random white belt in town, think about how many monsters    
you DIDN'T kill. Odds are quite good that every game you play, the occassional 
dragonball will spawn on a monster that you don't bother to fight. Or may      
not even see. It is very possible for a 'gaurunteed' dragonball drop monster   
to be 'denied' their dragonball drop request simply because random monsters    
spawned on the same level with a dragonball. Also, dragonballs have a          
tendancy to move around. Just because a certain monster is carrying a          
dragonball in one games doesn't mean he'll necessarily be carrying it in the   
next. This applies both to spawning *as well as to dialogue!* There are *NO*   
absolutely gaurunteed dragonball locations! Oh, there are many places where    
you'll consistantly be able to find a dragonball, as well as many uniques who  
will consistantly drop them. But, every single one of them is completely       
reliant on the dragonball tracker to give it permission to actually have       
a dragonball. No exceptions.

#####GQ. I don't understand the Ballet quest.                                  
                                                                               
A. What? Missing dancers? Cute little mice running around everywhere?          
An elegant King Mouse with a great big nasty sword? Ballet? Don't you          
get it? No? <sigh> The entire quest for Ballet is a reference to               
Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Ballet. You know...the one where the little           
girl (Clara) runs around with her Nutcracker prince for about two hours        
doing nothing in particular? The music is good, the dancing is usually         
good, and who doesn't absolutely love the Sugar Plum Fairy? Still, the         
story itself is really pretty dumb, and unfortunately it's an obligatory       
Christmas-time performance, so anybody who's ever studied Ballet has           
probably had to do the show about a zillion times. The quest should            
get a good laugh from anyone who's knows anything abotu Ballet, but            
it does seem to come up as a bizarre non-sequitor to everyone else.
