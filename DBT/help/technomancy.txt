#####GThe Path to Technomancer                                                 
                                                                               
#####B * Initial Quest                                                         
     Once you've completed one of the initial quests for Dr Briefs you'll be   
     given access to his Technology training script. This script will allow    
     you to purchase points on Technology skill for 3 skillpoints each, with   
     a cap equal to your Intelligence, and in no case greater than 20.         
#####B * Train to 20                                                           
     You will need to train your skill to twenty in order to proceed. Barring  
     Dragonball wishes, In general this means having an Intelligence of 20,    
     and investing 60 skillpoints. For maximum efficiency, starting with 14    
     Intelligence, and with gains only from the library, this means that the   
     average player will need to be level 25 before becoming a Technomancer.   
     Though, by increasing Intelligence at the Robbins Foundation, it should   
     theoretically be possible to become a Technomancer by approximately level 
     12.                                                                       
#####B * Complete the Assistant Quest                                          
     With 20 skill, the next time you speak to Dr Briefs you'll have a new     
     dialogue option in which you ask him to take you to the next level. He    
     will issue you Technical Assistant quest, which requires you to procure   
     a set of your own tools. Once this quest is completed, you will officially
     become a technomancer, and Dr Breifs will immediately train all three Tech
     skills to an additional +10. (30, 10 and 10) additionally you will be     
     allowed to use Dr Breifs' lab as a house to store anything you'd like, and
     to use anything already in storage there.                                 
#####B * Random Quests and Advanced Training (SEE NOTE, BELOW!)                
     Dr Briefs will also immediately give you a quest to build ONE semi-       
     randomly selected Techno device, and give you blueprints for how to build 
     it. (At present, even 'found' items are allowed, but in the future this   
     may be disallowed.) Every time you turn in a completed device (and only   
     when you do) you will granted acces to the Advanced Training script, which
     allows you to increase any of the three Techno skills by two full points  
     for only a single skillpoint. (Thus, 50 skillpoints to increase a skill   
     from zero to 100. Including basic training, it would cost 195 skillpoints 
     to increase all three Tech skill to 100.) As soon as you exit this script 
     Dr Briefs will imediately issue you another Random Build quest, which must
     be completed before gaining access to the training script again. Every    
     time you complete an additional Build quest, the possible range and       
     quality of devices which Dr Breifs may ask you (and teach you how) to     
     build will increase. It is possible to be issued multiple quests for the  
     same item (thus not learning anything new) but it is also possible to     
     eventually learn to build almost every electronics device from these      
     quests. (A few exceptions do exist. For example: Scouters may only be     
     found on Freeza's minions, and the Dragon radar is a special dialogue     
     case related to dialogue, though it will only be Technomancers who are    
     able to use the Dragon Radar in any case.)                                
#####B * Super High Tech and Spaceships                                        
     There are a number of recipes that may be learned for items that are      
     not possible to acquire via any other means short of wizard mode and      
     Dragonball wishes. As of the current version, these devices include:      
     EVA suits, radiation suits, jetpacks, and the Capsule Spaceship.          
                                                                               
                                                                               
#####BNOTE: This description is of how it is INTENDED to work.                 
Looking over the code as I write this a few hours before I'm planning on       
uploading the module, I notice that this isn't how it ACTUALLY works. The      
recipe selector will need to be re-written, but as of V085, here's the         
complete list of items that Dr Briefs may give you blueprints for, and         
the number of quests you need to complete before they're possible:
