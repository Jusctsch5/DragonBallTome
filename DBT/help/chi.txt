  Unlike the ToME magic system, Chi in Dragonball T is an                      
  advanced art that is unavailable to characters at the                        
  start of the game. Unlike the basic melee combatative                        
  arts which may be learned right away, it is rare to find                     
  Chi training in the early portions of the game.                              
                                                                               
V085: Chi is now on a new skill system. All Chi skills are                     
CUMUALTIVE in their gains from each Chi Master. For example,                   
if two Chi Masters offer the same Chi skill with a cap of                      
five, you would eb able to study with both masters for a total                 
of ten skill. Consequently, while the standard skill system                    
rewards people who specialize, Chi practitioners will become                   
more powerful the more Masters they have studied from.

        Your ability to direct your Chi offensively. This skill will           
determine which offensive abililties youa re able to learn, and how            
effective you will be at using them.

        The rate at which you are able to restore your depleted energies.      
Each point of regeneration grants 1/20th of a point of Chi regenerated         
per turn. Yes, 1/20th of a point. The Chi system is more subtle than

effect. Chi Instant Effects are accessed via the 'U'se Ability command.

Any ability which may be turned on and off at any time, and generates          
a sonstant drain on your energy reserves for as long as it is 'on.'            
Many Constant Effects may also be engaged at varying intensities.

Chi skills and abilities are learned from Master Trainers in a manner          
similar to combat skills are learned from the schools. Finding trainers        
is often difficult, and once found, they will often require you to             
complete quests before they'll offer you any training. Each Master             
offers a unique set of skills, caps and abilities, which may sometimes         
be expanded upon via quests, but there is no standard 'dojo elimination'       
system amongst the Master Trainers, and their training will never cost         
money.
