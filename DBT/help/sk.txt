#####GOverview                                                                 
At the start of the game you are allotted 5 skill points, and you will gain    
six more with every level. These points may be spend at the various trainers   
to increase your skills and learn new abilities. In general, there are three   
different types of trainers: 'Schools' 'Master Teachers' and 'Other'           
                                                                               
 * Schools:                                                                    
   (Karate, Kungfu, Kickboxing, TaeKwonDo, Sumo, Judo, Ninjutsu, Ballet)       
   Each school offers a different set of skills and abilities. At the start    
   of the game, each skill will have a preset 'cap' which is the maximum       
   level to which it may be trained. These caps may be increased by completing 
   a 'Challenge Quest' and by forcing other schools to close.                  
                                                                               
 * Master Teachers:                                                            
   (Rosshi, Tsuru Seni'Nin, Musashi, Korin, Mr. Popo, etc.)                    
   Masters each work according to their own rules, but in general:             
   * Gaining access to them will require completion of quests                  
   * They will often be difficult to physically reach                          
   * They will occassionally be more skill-point expensive to train with than  
     the schools                                                               
   * They're caps will be higher than the starting point for schools, but lower
     than the maximum cap for schools                                          
   * In general, the 'early game' Master Teachers will provide low level skill 
     coverage for 'must have' skills that some schools don't offer at all. For 
     example, a dedicated Judo practitioner can get up to 10 con from Rosshi.  
   * In general the 'late game' Master Teachers will offer pretty much most    
     skills at relatively high levels, though 'how relatively' and 'how high'  
     is undecided. It seems reasonable to me that The North Kaio, for instance 
     could teach anything better than anybody at a school, but this may or may 
     not actually be possible for balance reasons. In any case, skill levels   
     in the 60-80 range will probably eventually be available across the board 
     from the higher level Master Teachers.                                    
                                                                               
 * Other:                                                                      
   (Places like the YMCA, Dr's Tofu/Briefs/Gero, the Robbins Institute, etc.   
   Ballet may eventually be moved to this category as well.) These are fairly  
   fixed places to learn the remaining skills and abilities that either        
   everyone should have easy access to (First Aid, Swimming, etc) or that      
   didn't nicely fit into the schools model (Charisma)

#####GHow it will play out:                                                    
In the early game, the schools will be your primary access to fighting skills. 
Eventually you'll be able to raise most any skill to a 'moderately high' level 
from the appropriate Master Teacher, but in general the HIGHEST skills will    
eventually be taught by your selected school(s). At approximately the time you 
reach the cap of the 'primary' fighting skill of a school, the head instructor 
will issue you a quest to defeat the instructor of their 'rival' school. Once  
you have completed this quest, the various training caps at your school will   
be increased (and will continue to increase) based on the number of schools    
that have been closed. The more schools have closed, the higher the caps for   
the remaining schools for which a Challenge Quest has been completed, will be. 
Any school that you train at MAY NEVER BE CHALLENGED.                          
                                                                               
So...you will choose a school, or perhaps a few, and train to your cap.        
You'll then be issued a quest, and then you'll probbaly have to start          
completing quests for Master Teachers so that you can train with them to       
the point of being able to complete the Challenge Quest. Once you do,          
you'll finish off the rest of the schools, and have access to the highest      
possible level of training for the school(s) you've chosen to study at,        
which will, by now, be higher than the training offered by most Master         
Teachers. Note that regardless of the stated cap, schools will never be        
able to train you to any skill more than your current level + 10

#####GGeneral Comments                                                         
 * Don't expect to be able to perform your challenge quest the moment you      
   receive it. You may need to study at a Master Teacher first. Remember,      
   none of the instructors have been able to defeat their rivals...don't       
   expect them to be able to train you to.                                     
 * Note also that several schools offer classes which have prerequisites       
   that they CANNOT teach you until after some number of other schools         
   have been closed. Both Karate and Sumo will teach Tameshiware, for          
   instance, but Sumo teaches it early on, whereas Karate requires that        
   you close six schools first.
