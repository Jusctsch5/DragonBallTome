[[[[[BStrength] is a measure of your ability to apply physical force with      
your body.                                                                     
 * Every point above or below ten will modify your melee damage                
 * It determines your carrying capacity. Every point of strength allows        
   you to carry ten pounds without any difficulty. Every five pounds           
   over the limit will give you a -1 speed penalty.                            
                                                                               
~~~~~2|Intelligence                                                            
[[[[[BIntelligence] is a measure of your ability to think and understand       
things.                                                                        
 * It is the sole factor determining your searching ability                    
 * It affects your ability to identify items. For every point above or         
   below ten, intelligence will modify the identify skill requirement          
   in, or out of your favor.                                                   
 * It determines the limit of Technology training you'll be able to receive    
   from Dr Briefs. This limit will be your intelligence, minus seven.          
                                                                               
~~~~~3|Willpower                                                               
[[[[[BWillpower] is a measure of your ability to focus and see something       
through without being distracted or discouraged.                               
 * Your maximum Chi pool will be equal to your Willpower * Chi skill           
 * Willpower grants a limited ability to resist negative mental effects        
 * When playing as a discarnate spirit, your hit points will be equal to       
   your Willpower * your level.                                                
                                                                               
~~~~~4|Dexterity                                                               
[[[[[BDexterity] is a measure of your agility and coordination. It directly    
affects your chances of hitting, and being hit in combat. Every point of       
dexterity above or below 10 will alter your to-hit and armor class by an       
equal amount. For example, with a 14 dexterity, you would receive +4 tohit     
and armor class, whereas with a 7 dexterity you would receive a -3 tohit and   
armor class. Dexterity also affects your ability to avoid traps and            
pickpockets, contributes to your rate of speed when running, and affects       
your success rates with certain abilities.                                     
                                                                               
~~~~~5|Constitution                                                            
[[[[[BConstitution] is a measure of your general physical health and stamina.  
It is largely responsible for determining the number of hit points you have,   
how much damage you can sustain before death. For every experience level you   
gain, you will gain a number of hit points equal to your constitution. Thus,   
at 5th level, with 12 constitution, you would have 60 hit points.              
                                                                               
~~~~~6|Charisma                                                                
[[[[[BCharisma] is a measure of your good looks and charm. The higher your     
charisma, the more likely the people you meet are to like you. The lower it    
is, well, the less likely they'll like you. When it comes to buying and        
selling goods, every point of charisma below 10 adjusts prices out of your     
favor by 10%. Every point of charisma above 10 affects the prices 1% in your   
favor. Thus, at 8 charisma, you would be paying 20% more for everything you    
buy, and receiving 20% less for items you sell. At 15 charisma, you would be   
paying 5% less, and receiving 5% more. And yes, at 100 Charisma, everything    
you find at a store is free. Additionally, a high charisma provides social     
lubrication, thus affecting the value of rewards people are willing to give    
you for completeing quests for them and occassionally a high charisma will     
will even open up dialogue options unavailable to the less charismatic.        
Dialogue options made available due to high charisma will be marked:           
(Persuade)                                                                     
                                                                               
~~~~~7|Speed                                                                   
[[[[[BSpeed] is the primary factor which determines your movement rate. With a 
ten speed, your movement rate will be 'normal.' For every point of speed above 
or below ten, your movement rate will be affected by that much also. Thus,     
with 5 speed, you would move with a -5 penalty, and with 12 speed you would    
move at +2. Note that net movement values work in increments of 10. At +10     
movement speed, you would be moving twice as fast as a movement rate 0. At     
30, you'd be moving three times as fast.
