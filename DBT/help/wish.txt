Dragonball T wishes are extremely flexible, and in general pretty much anything
may be wished for. No, really...try it. Wish for anything.

 * Wishes must begin with 'I wish'                                             
 * Wishes may not interfere with the free will of any conscious being          
 * Wishes may not contain numbers of any kind                                  
 * Spelling and spacing between words must be correct                          
 * It is not always necessary to be specific                                   
 * Complete sentences are usually ok, and sometimes necessary                  
 * Item wishes are more delicate than non-item wishes                          
 * You are allowed a couple mistakes, but...                                   
 * People who annoy Shenron may not get their wish granted                     
                                                                               
It should be pointed out though, that Shenron is basically on your side.       
He's not out to trick you through clever interpretation, nor will he try       
to cheat you out of having your wish granted. In fact, most of the time        
if he's uncertain about what you're asking for, he'll give you his best        
guess, then ask you to confirm that's really what you want. If it isn't,       
simply tell him no and try making another wish. But don't do this too          
many times...                                                                  
                                                                               
...Shenron is not very patient.                                                
                                                                               
[[[[[BAvoiding Problems]                                                       
                                                                               
The wish parser is designed to be flexible, but it does have limits. Basically 
the parser looks for key expressions it recognizes, and responds to them.      
Consequently, while excessive verbage and very specific requests may sometimes 
work fine, other times it may lead to inaccurately granted wishes. For example,
while:                                                                         
                                                                               
'I wish to be a really super mega strong! Yeah baby!'                          
                                                                               
...is a perfectly valid wish, and will work quite nicely, if you give too many 
words unrelated to what you really want, sometimes those extra words will be   
recognized as expressions. For example:                                        
                                                                               
'I wish to have a nifty stealth bomber with a cute blonde co-pilot.'           
                                                                               
This is a case in which the wish parser really doesn't know what you're asking 
for, so it finds the only word it recognizes: 'Stealth' and assumes you want   
your stealth skill increased. Not what you were asking for, but fortunately    
you'll be prompted if Stealth is really what you want, and you can simply say  
no.                                                                            
                                                                               
In particular, wishes for items are somewhat more sensitive to excessive       
verbage. For example, while all of these will work:                            
                                                                               
'I wish for an escrima stick.'                                                 
'I wish for a serated knife'                                                   
'I wish to have a strip of squid jerky, please.'                               
                                                                               
None of these will work:                                                       
                                                                               
'I wish for a dozen escrima sticks.'                                           
'I wish for a very serated knife'                                              
'I wish to have a yummy strip of squid jerky, please.'                         
                                                                               
In general, avoid adding adjectives when wishing for items.
