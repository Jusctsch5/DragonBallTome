These are design notes. Eventually this will be formatted into a more          
pleasant-to-read format;.                                                      
                                                                               
Total Chi pool = Willpower * Chi skill                                         
                                                                               
With zero Chi Regeneration skill, you will regenerate at 1/20th of a point     
of Chi per round (This is slow)                                                
                                                                               
Otherwise, every point of regeneration gives you 1/5th of a point of           
regeneration per round                                                         
                                                                               
Thus, every 5 points of Chi Regeneration gives you one full point of           
regeneration per round                                                         
                                                                               
At 5 Regeneration, you'll regenerate one point per round                       
At 10 Regeneration, you'll regenerate two points per round                     
At 25 Regeneration, you'll regenerate five points per round                    
At 50 Regeneration, you'll regenerate ten points per round                     
At 100 Regeneration, you'll regenerate twenty points per round                 
                                                                               
Meditation skill doubles these rates

Flight and Battle Aura cost 100 / Chi-Gung per round to maintain               
                                                                               
Thus, with zero (or 1) Chi Gung, it will cost 100Chi / turn                    
                                                                               
At 10 Chi Gung, it will cost 10/turn                                           
At 20 Chi Gung, it will cost 5/turn                                            
At 50 Chi Gung, it will cost 2/turn                                            
At 100 Chi Gung, it will cost 1/turn                                           
                                                                               
Thus, with 20 Chi Gung, 25 Chi Regeneration, and Meditation, you'll be able to 
maintain a Battle Aura, and fly, FOREVER.

Battle Aura and Flight TOGETHER AT ONCE will, in effect, grant you the ability 
to fly through space. Try not to run out of Chi while doing this.

Chi Skills works on a unique system. All Chi skill training is CUMULATIVE.     
For example, if two different Chi Masters offer a particular Chi skill with    
a cap of five, you would be able to study from both Masters to a total of ten. 
Note that this training exists right along side the regular skill training     
system. A Chi Master may teach both Chi skills, and non-Chi skills from the    
same script.
