Dragonball T is a psuedo-graphical game in the genre of 'Rogue.'               
Gameplay is 'visual' with an overhead view of the game map, but                
the graphics themselves are keyboard characters. Your character                
is represented by the @ sign in the middle of the display, and                 
different characters represent different sort of things. For                   
example, numbers are stores. Letters in the alphabet are usually               
monsters. Punctuation is generally either terrain, or equipment.               
                                                                               
Now, you may be asking yourself 'why would anyone make a game                  
like this?' The answer is simple: graphics take an awful lot                   
of time and energy to build. Time and energy that some game                    
designers would rather devote to making a game both fun and                    
interesting. You've probably played commercially produced games                
with incredible graphics that left you bored out of your mind                  
after a few hours. Games in which, 'double clicking on monsters'               
constituted 98% of gameplay.                                                   
                                                                               
That's not fun.                                                                
                                                                               
Here, a designer is able to focus on fun rather than graphics,                 
and you may be surprised at the complexity and subtle nuances                  
of some games in this genre.                                                   
                                                                               
If this is your first time playing a rogue-like, it may take                   
some time to get used to the interface. Stick with it. It                      
will be worthwhile.

 * Numbers are stores                                                          
 * Letters are usually monsters                                                
 * You can move using the arrow keys                                           
 * If a monster is friendly, you can talk to it by                             
   moving into it                                                              
 * If it's not friendly, you can fight it by moving                            
   into it                                                                     
 * Upper-case and lower-case are different, whether it's                       
   a monster, or a command.                                                    
 * You can view your inventory by pressing 'i' (inventory)                     
 * You can wear/wield items by pressing 'w' (wear/wield)                       
 * You can pick things up from the ground by pressing 'g' (get)                
 * You can save and exit the game by pressing ctrl-x (exit)                    
 * You can look around you by pressing 'l' (look)                              
 * You may view your character sheet by pressing 'C' (character)               
 * You may view your current skills by pressing 'G'                            
 * You may increase your skills by studying at a school. Look                  
   for the number '4.' There are four schools immediately                      
   accessible, directly south of where you first start, near the               
   World Tournament building.                                                  
 * When looking at armor, for example: streetclothes (-1) [5, +0]              
   * The '-1' is a to-hit penalty (not all will have this)                     
   * The '5' is the base armor value of that armor type                        
   * The '+0' is a  bonus specific to that particular piece                    
     of armor based on quality of workmanship                                  
 * When looking at weapons, for example: kubotan (1d4) (+0, +1)                
   * The '1d4' is a damage range, expressed in dice. The second                
     number is ths number of sides on the die. The first is the                
     number of times it will be rolled. '1d4' means '1 to 4'                   
     '3d5' means '3 to 15' etc. Some weapons may express their                 
     damage explicity, for example '10to25.'                                   
   * The first plus, '+0' in this case, is a to-hit bonus specifc              
     to the wepon                                                              
   * The second plus, '+1' in this case, is a damage bonus                     
     specific to the weapon                                                    
 * If the letter of an item shows up as dark grey, that means                  
   you don't know what it is, and will need to 'identify' it                   
   to know more about it.                                                      
 * Verbose descriptions of items is available by pressing 'I'                  
   (Note: capitol 'I')                                                         
 * Pay attention to the information on the left menu, as well                  
   as the bottom line of your screen.                                          
                                                                               
And finally...please read this very carefully:                                 
                                                                               
 * Death is usually permanent.

You've probably noticed that you were never asked for race or class            
during character creation, and that you cannot spend skill via the             
G screen.                                                                      
                                                                               
Character advancement in Dragonball T occurs gradually, and over the course    
of the entire game. You don't simply decide to 'be a martial artist' and       
magically know everything about martial arts. Rather, you will have to choose  
individual skills and abilities to learn. Some skills may be learned simply    
by taking classes. Others requires practice. Still others are only available   
through the completion of quests. The basic skill system is accessed via the   
various martial arts schools. From your starting location near the World       
Tournament building, there are two such school, for Karate and Kung-fu         
located conveintly nearby in the buildings directly south. If you are just     
beginning, just pick one, enroll in classes and learn some basic skills to     
get you started. In time, you'll find more school to choose from which         
offer different skill sets. Be aware that while many schools are compatible,   
some are not. Once you study Karate, you will no longer be able to study       
Kickboxing.

Dragonball T handles many aspects of equipment somewhat differently. The       
first thing you'll notice is the complete and total lack of many of the        
basic accessories you're accustomed to in a rogue-like game. No scrolls        
of identify, no healing potions, no word of recall scrolls. Many of these      
functions simply do not exist. Others have been replaced with new systems.     
For instance, identification is now skill based. If you are skilled with       
weapons, you will be knowledgeable enough to instantly understand the          
uses and limitations of weapons you find. If you're generally skilled in       
martial arts, you'll understand how wearing armor will affect your ability     
to fight. Etc.

[[[[[BQuests]                                                                  
Dragonball T is HEAVILY quest-driven. There are nearly 100 quests avaialable   
over the course of the game, and several possible game-endings. Dragonball T   
has the trappings of a rogue-like, but in many ways resembles an RPG. There    
are many paths to finish the game, and you may pick and choose which quests    
to accept, and which to complete. Just because a quest is offered does not     
mean you have to accept it, and just because a quest is issued does not mean   
you have to complete it. Further, there is not merely a single 'plotline'      
but rather, your choices DO affect what is going on in the world around you.   
Just because a certain event occurred, or situation existed in one game,       
does not mean that it will necessarily exist, or play out the same way in      
the next. Often it will. But don't be surprised when it doesn't. Dragonball    
T is not entirely linear.

The Chi system in Dragonball T works very differently than magic in ToME.      
                                                                               
 * It's mostly a middle and late game phenomenon. Don't be surprised           
   if your characters aren't using Chi much before level 30.                   
                                                                               
 * There are five Chi skills:
