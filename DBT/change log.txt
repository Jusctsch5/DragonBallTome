Systems:
 * Stores now refresh
 * The cloth-type item enhancement system has been
   heavily clarified

New Content:
 * Roughly 60K of new dialogue
 * The Ninjutsu Challenge quest has been implemented
 * New ego type: Wildly inaccurate
 * New items: scopes, cloth, scissors, single and double
   barreled shotguns, scattershot, lead slugs, shaolin monk
   robes and forearm wraps
 * Buruma may now encapsulate and carry objects for the player
 * The Buddhist Temple has been converted into a late-early
   game dungeon of levels 17-23. New dialogue, monsters and
   quests accompany this.
 * New quest: Save the Temple
 * Several more (but not all) marriage permutations are now
   possible amongst Oolong, Rosshi, Chichi, Videl, Lunch and
   Buruma. If you think it might work, try it. It might.
 * It is now possible for male characters to get training
   from Rosshi. There may be more solutions than is
   immediately obvious.

Rulechanges and Balance:
 * Any player who makes it to level 25 may now survive death
   as a spirit
 * Increased Kungfu parrying skill gains from 1.2 to 1.5
   Increased kungfu paired skill gains from 1.5 to 2.0
 * As per Sirrocco's suggestion, certain monster changes
   have been made to create a broader variety of monster
   'danger' relative to monster 'sturdiness.' There are now
   some monsters which are quite deadly, but relatively easy
   to kill, as well as monsters which are not very
   dangerous, but hard to kill.
 * Krillan has been made much less powerful, and is no longer
   a trainer. The temple Abbot takes his place as Chi Master.
 * The sewers are now lit. The first unlit dungeon players will
   generally encounter is now the Ninja Warehouse.
 * Dungeon item drop quantities have been generally reduced,
   and in some cases eliminated. Monster drop quantities have
   generally been increased. This should reduce incentive for
   stair scumming in palces like Mr. Satan's Estate. 
 * Gym and library no longer accept "donations" from members
   

Firearms:
 * New firearms: shotuns, double barreled shotguns
   Shotguns fire all loaded rounds in volleys
   high capacity double barreled shotgun = LOTS of damage
 * New shotgun ammo: scattershot, lead slug
 * Implemented semi/fully automatic toggles for machine
   guns. While firing at range while in fully automatic mode,
   a machine gun will fire a five round burst, with each round
   targetting any of the nine spaces within one space of the
   intended target. Shots fired at point blank range are
   targetted normally.
 * Scopes have been implemented. Any firearm with a scope
   is treated as being five spaces closer to target for
   range penalties. Thus, anything up to five spaces away is
   terated as point blank range, a target at seven spaces
   would be treated as if at only two, etc.
 * Firearm subsystem can now handle variable reload types
 * Damage information is now more properly stored in
   ammunition rather than firearms. Consequently, each
   individual ammo SVAL may now specify its own damage
   range, type and area of effect
 * Fixed AP. Only armor piercing ammo will reduce targets
   AC in half.
 * Migrated FIXED_PROJ weapons to LOOKUP_PROJ
 * Firearms now indicate what type of ammo they have loaded
   when inspected
 * Machine guns may now toggle between single burst and
   fully automatic firing modes
 * Firearm range, damage and ammo capacities have generally
   been increased
 * New firearm ego: wildly inaccurate

New issues:
 * Inspecting ammunition really should indicate whether it is
   armor piercing. (AP clips and lead slugs may peirce armor)

Bugfixes:
 * Trunks training updated to the enrollment system
 * Kinto Un now leaves when removed (Gah! Hours!!!)
 * Random items may now receive pluses again
 * Items should auto-id again
 * There should be no more double egos, though I've never seen one so it's difficult for me to check
 * Inventory letters for ego items should now always highlight in blue
 * I belive I have fixed issues relating to ego and artifact generation
 * It is once again possible to enroll in ninjutsu
 * Fixed some screen corruptions relating to Oolong's marriage
 * Disarming traps no longer causes your strength skill to increase
 * Corrected Sakura's misleading challenge dialogue
 * Applied NerdanelVampire's add_flag fix, thus fixing fur-lined, studded and designer egos. Ego bonuses now ''add'' instead of ''replace'' item bonuses
 * Updated some quest descriptions that were still using the alpha14 convention
 * Fixed an error relating to Trunks' enrollment
 * Applied EtMarc's solution for FS#108. It seems to work! Yay! :)
 * Fixed a LUA error in Yamcha's AI
 * Fixed: Can eat from corpses again
 * Fixed: can no longer eat from a corpse infinitely many times
 * Fixed: The 'z' LUA error bug
 * Fixed: Imelda now properly gives desinger shoes, when appropriate
 * It is now possible to train/speak/challenge the Ninja instructor
 * Entering stores should no longer occassionally generate LUA errors now
 * Ahhhaaa!!!! Fixed the LUA error in the Foot Lair
 * Fixed Tenshinhan and Chaozu's AI's
 * Fixed a screen corruption in Videl's dialogue
 * ...and I quote from the change log... "Fixed a bunch of stuff that was broken."
