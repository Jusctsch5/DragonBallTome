#####G(a)Guess What? You're Dead!                                              
Welcome to the afterlife! If your'e reading this, it means that                
you are one of those rare, sufficiently willed individuals who                 
is able to maintain coherency after the dissolution of the                     
physical form. To put it anyother way, your mind is strong enough              
that you don't need a body to function. Don't be surprised. It                 
was never your body that kept you running to begin with. It was                
just a convenient vessel to store your will. It's the soul that                
matters, and it's a good thing too, because that's all you've got              
now.                                                                           
                                                                               
~~~~~2                                                                         
#####G(b)What's Different Now That I'm Dead?                                   
Your physical body is gone. That changes some things you're probably           
used to. The first thing you'll probably notice is that you're no              
longer able to interact with most objects. This is good, in a way,             
because you can float through walls and doors. But it's also bad, in           
a way, because you can no longer pick things up like weapons.                  
Interestingly, you still can interact with conscious beings, in a              
way. You see...in reality, this whole physical world that you're               
used to is really not nearly as 'solid' or 'tangible' as you've                
previously thought. Spirit precedes form. There can be spirit without          
form, but there can be no form without spirit. Thus, you as                    
consciousness are still able to interact with consciousness, and               
you'll find that your mental habits and expectations will be the               
key method that will allow you to do this. For instance, you should            
be able to walk up to a monster and punch it. Try it. You'll probably          
even hurt it. Don't misundertsand...it's not that you're really                
punching the monster...you just think you are. What you're thinking            
of as a punch is really just a ay for your mind to represent to                
yourself a far more complicated act of spirit. If you have the time,           
you might try reading books by Gurdjieff. Or, if you don't, go rent            
the movie Ghost, it should help.                                               
                                                                               
Oh, wait. You're dead. You can't do that. Sorry.                               
                                                                               
~~~~~3                                                                         
#####G(c)No, really...what's different?]                                       
Ok, ok. Here's the list:                                                       
                                                                               
1) You may only use or carry artifacts, no other item types.                   
2) Your hit points are now determined by Willpower instead of                  
   Constitution.                                                               
3) Everything that you previously had on your body...is still                  
   on your body. Wherever that is. Don't count on it still being               
   there when you get back.                                                    
4) All your Barehanded and Chi related skills and combat                       
   continue to work the same.                                                  
5) You can walk through doors, trees, and occassionally through                
   walls                                                                       
6) Some people may be hesitant to talk to ghosts.                              
7) If you 'die' again...that's it. ***POOF!!!***                               
                                                                               
~~~~~4                                                                         
#####G(d)How Do I Get Not-Dead?                                                
Hahahahaha!!!                                                                  
                                                                               
Good question. I bet there's a way, though.                                    
                                                                               
~~~~~5                                                                         
#####G(e)Anything else I should know?                                          
                                                                               
Yes. If you're not reading this from Heaven right now, either:                 
                                                                               
 A) You are on the Serpent's Path. This is where souls go who are              
    neither suffienctly good to go to Heaven, nor sufficiently                 
    evil to go to Hell. Be warned that it is an extremely treacherous          
    and dangerous place. If you fall from the path you will fall               
    a very long ways into Hell, and demons have been known to                  
    try to lead travellers astray. You might take a moment to                  
    speak with Emma, the Daio responsible for judging souls. He                
    may have some useful information for you.                                  
                                                                               
 B) You are in Hell. This is even more dangerous than the Serpent's            
    Path, and the fires around you will make you perma-dead fast.              
    Better head for high ground as soon as possible.
