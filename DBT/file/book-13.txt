#####G(a)Hello!
This is the third unoffical public release. At this point
the game is, loosely speaking 'playable.' There is only one
insta-crash bug that I'm aware of (avoid Korin tower) and you
will occassionally see non-fatal LUA errors when stepping on
traps. I've actually played several characters up to level 10
before they died, and one who survived all the way to level 26
before he ran out of things to do.

#####G(b)To Submit a Bug Report
If convenient, submit bug reports for Dragonball T on the wiki.
I've created a bug report section on the DBT page. That should
be a little easier than navigating the official bug report forum.
If you don't feel comfortable with the Wiki feel welcome to submit
via email to lordbucket@hotmail.com.

#####G(c)Noteworthy Changes since Version 0.2.9
Wow...lots of things.
1) The World Tournament totally re-made
2) Karate, Kungfu, Kickboxing and TaeKwonDo are completely functional.
3) Two new schools: Judo and Sumo. They're mostly functional.
   By all means study at these schools, but be forewarned that
   no Challenge Quest rewards exist for them yet.
4) Basic implementation of the Chi system
5) Several new quests. Some of them are even completable.
6) Several new dungeons.
7) About 20 new uniques
8) There are now 19 abilities, though only about a half of
   them are actually accessible within the game, and of those
   only half are fully functional. (The firearms abiltiies are
   'functional' but the firearms system is presently unavailable,
   so there's not much you can do with them.)
9) Melee combat is pretty much done.
10) Three new 'special' locations: The Serpent's Path, the planet
   of the North Kaio, Hell.
11) Lots of humor has been added. :)
12) A simple alignment system has been added.
13) Module archive is now a .team file, thanks to Nerdanel
   Vampire (sp?) for pointing out that it wasn't.

#####G(d)Current Issues
1) Engine Bug: monsters placed on the surface are incorrectly
duplicated in all adjacent surface towns. So, at the moment
I'm refraining from placing Uniques like Yamcha, Lunch and
Bulma, who would ordindarily hang out in the town.
2) Engine bug: Weird limitation on hp regen is being amplified
by some changes I've made, so the regen rate is extremely slow
to avoid an insta-crash the second you start the game. Annoying,
but unavoidable at the moment.
3) Engine limitation: It is not possible to make map. symbols
query independant variables. Even worse, they can only check
the status of a SINGLE quest variable. This makes implementation
of certain quests I have planned...difficult. Maybe not possible,
I'm not sure. I haven't thought of a way yet, anyway.
4) I haven't figured out a way to teleport from a dungeon to a town
without invoking High Weirdness. In particular, the map borders
fail to re-size, so you end up with a truncated town that
spawns dungeon monsters. Consequently some of the 'neat stuff'
I have in mind is not doable, yet. I don't think this is a bug,
or engine limitation, it's just that the wizard mode command is
incorrect, so I don't have a functional example to work from, and
much of the code is compiled and inaccessible, so I basically have
to ask around.
5) Like the companion code: It's also hard-coded. I have several
quest concepts planned that require me to make companions, but
there is no example of this anywhere to work from.

#####G(e)Fixnotes 'todo' list
Curiosly, while the changelog is now 34K, the fix-me list is
now 10K. Last I checked is was about 28 and 6. I hope it doesn't
continue at that rate. :) In any case, see fix notes.txt for
a more complete list of current issues.

Enjoy!
