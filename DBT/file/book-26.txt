* NOTE: Dragonball T is now using its own function to determine                
  whether monsters land melee blows. Level is now a stronger                   
  factor in determining to-hit chances, and overall monsters                   
  will be hitting you a little more often than they did.

#####G(d)New Bugs and issues                                                   
New bugs/issues:                                                               
* Muscle Stimulators/Sushi not removed from inventory after marrying           
  Videl                                                                        
* No ego type filtering: Some egos may attach to extremely                     
  counterintuitive item types                                                  
* Ego based ac bonuses are applied as to hit bonuses (engine?)                 
* "Aura" effects from spiked/bladed armor types should be more                 
  ffective for barehanded fighters with AB_BLOCKING                            
* Ego flags are being set, NOT added. Thus, strange situations may             
  occur. For example, fur-lined trenchcoats provide less protection            
  from cold than trenchcoats without fur lining. Designer tuxedos              
  offer less of a charisma bonus than regular tuxedos. Etc.                    
* For some reason you can no longer buy things back from the pawnshop :/       
* There should probably be a display indicator for planets that have           
  high gravity                                                                 
* Chi Constant Effects don't turn off when you run out of Chi                  
* Heaven not behaving as intended                                              
* The alternate stairway out of Mr Satan's training room behaves very          
  strangely
