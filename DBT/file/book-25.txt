 * New buildings: Robbins Foundation, YMCA                                     
 * New dungeon/area: Frozen Wastes                                             
 * New uniques: Iron Monkey, Yajirobe, Uranai Baba, Tsuru-Seni'nin, Tenshinhan 
 * New artifacts: Daniel San's Headband, Shaolin Soccer Ball, Ryoga's Headband 
   Ryoga's Umbrella, Trunks' Sword, Purple Jade Badger, Golden Nimbus          
   Uranai Baba's Crystal Ball, Pelt of the White Wolf                          
 * New items: Chinese rounded hammers, chainsaw, saiyan battle jacket,         
   blowtorch, taser, cattle prod                                               
 * Partial implementation of Tameshiware                                       
 * Implemented Bear Thief and Hasuki quests (Beware!!!)

 * The earth maps have been slightly rearranged                                
 * About 40K of dialogue has been scrapped and re-written. Some things may     
   have changed. Most notably, the Emma Daio is completely different.          
 * The various lighting issues have generally been improved upon               
                                                                               
New bugs and issues:                                                           
* No flying artifacts seem to work                                             
* Whoops...eating/quaffing during the Tournament doesn't disqualify you        
  like it should. Obviously this makes the martial arts sushi eating           
  technique much less useful                                                   
* RYOGA flags need to be applied as intrinsics, not searched for in slots      
* Emma Daio's dialogue does not account for certain scenarios. For example,    
  if you walk the path and speak to him while alive, he does not recognize     
  you when you subsequently die and get sent to him.

* Fixed some leftover errors in dragonball drop rates

* General purge of old math-mode skill code

  properly cleared with new games now                                          
* Rule Change: First Aid kits now require knowledge of the First Aid ability,  
  not tech skill                                                               
* Migrated instructor dialogues out of store actions and into dialogue and     
  disabled the dialogues relating to abilities that are now standard class     
  material                                                                     
* Added the Robbins Foundation and YMCA                                        
* Wine bottles should stack properly now                                       
* Note: The Briefs random quest rewards are +1 for easy, and +1, +3, +5 to     
  all, and the upgrade quest is +10 to all. So, playing a Technomancer         
  should be considerably less painful now.                                     
* Fixed the blindfold/earmuff swapping issue

* Fixed ai's on Planet 79

  .acquired)

Tuesday, Janurary 2, 2007                                                      
* Added placeholders for: Yajirobe, Uranai Baba, Tenshinhan, Tsuru Seni'nin    
* New artifact: Uranai Baba's Crystal Ball                                     
* 'Fixed' the randomly spawning Gym 'bug' ('p' was my testing key.)            
* Updated skill 'unhide/learning' for the new skill system                     
* Technomancers may now specify a quantity when disassembling items. Part      
  scavenging and recipe learning will be rolled separately for each item       
* It should be possible to deliver sushi to Mr Satan now                       
* Starving College students are now neutral to the player                      
* Temporary fix for the game locking up in Castle Pilaf and Muscle Tower.      
  It seems to be related to the 'name' field. I've removed them. Now looking   
  at them generates messages like 'You see stairs down' instead of 'You see    
  the entrance to Castle Pilaf' but it doesn't lock. Good trade.               
* Massive rearrangement of the monster distribution. Should be invisible to    
  the player.

  going to list them all. 'It's different'                                     
* Wiped the old Chi training system, and associated dialogues                  
* Migrated Korin to the new system                                             
* Scrapped Rosshi's dialogue and started over
