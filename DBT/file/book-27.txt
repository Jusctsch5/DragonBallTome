 With Anime Los Angeles this past weekend, and due to a few failed             
 attempts to upload the update, V083 is a week late. That's bad in that        
 people had to wait...but it's good in that it's turned out to be a            
 a much larger release that it would otherwise have been.                      
                                                                               
 Enjoy!

~~~~~4                                                                         
#####G(d)Changes to Dr Breifs Tech Quests                                      
Players performing Tech quests for Dr Briefs now have a choice of two          
separate, but mutually compatible, quest branches:                             
                                                                               
Casual Tech:                                                                   
Upon completion of any of the various starter quests for Dr Briefs, you        
will gain access to the basic trainer script, which allows you to learn        
up to 10 points of Technology, at 3 skillpoints each. There is a CAP           
on Technology skill learned via this method, however. Your Tech skill          
limit (again, via this particular method) will be equal to your intelligence   
minus 7. Thus, from the possible starting range of  8-12, a new character      
will potentially be able to train technology skill to a max of 1 to 5.         
                                                                               
Technomancer                                                                   
Any player who increases their Technology skill to 10 will then be offered     
the opportunity to become Briefs' assistant, provided they procure they own    
tools. (Basically, requires an intelligence of 17. Assuming you don't want     
to invest skill points in Intelligence at the Robbins Foundation, relying      
solely on gains from teh library, this means that a character starting with    
8 intelligence will need to make level 40 before becoming a Technomancer,      
and a character starting with 12 intelligence will need to make level 20.)     
                                                                               
Players who take this route this will receive the Briefs crash course, and     
all three Tech skills will be increased to 10. From there, the player will     
be be given a series of assignments to build a number of progressively         
complicated items. Each time a quest is issued, Dr Briefs will provide a set   
of blueprints to work from, and each time a quest is completed, the player     
will be rewarded with additional techno-skills skillpoints.

#####G(e)Important Note for Experienced Players!                               
NOTE: I've finally enabled, and partially developed a certain long-planned     
twist to the time-travel subplot of the Dr Briefs quest tree that's been       
sitting around mostly commented out for quite a while now. New players won't   
notice it. People who have been playing for a while are going to trip this     
subplot RIGHT AWAY by doing something that a new player wouldn't know to do,   
but that more experienced players probably do every game. It is not completely 
implemented, and at present it's using the generic summoning scripts for       
Androids 17 and 18, but tripping this plot thread has the potential to make    
you VERY DEAD.                                                                 
                                                                               
You have been warned.                                                          
                                                                               
                                                                               
Enjoy!
