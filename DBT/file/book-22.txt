#####GSo here's the deal:                                                      
                                                                               
Waiting on skill gains isn't fun. Suffering skill point losses for not waiting 
on skills gains is also not fun. So...hence the experiment.                    
                                                                               
The theory is very simple: retroactively apply skill modifier changes to       
any skill points already spent. If you invest 10 skill points at a .1 mod,     
you have 1 net skill. If you then increase your mod to .2, you then have       
2 net skill without spending any additional skill points.                      
                                                                               
Unfortuantely it's not as simple as that, and if this goes 'official' then     
I'm going to have to rewrite absolutely everything having anything to do       
with skill points, from the interface down to each and every single random     
quest that rewards you a single skill point.                                   
                                                                               
#####GPlayers who choose to play Experimental characters will:                 
                                                                               
 * Have a weird, kludgy skill-gain screen                                      
                                                                               
 * Not get any skill value increases from absolutely anything...other than     
   skill points spent via the above, weird, kludgy interface. Example:         
   You study Karate. The screen will tell you that you gained +1 to barehanded 
   value, and +.6 to barehanded mod. Guess what? You get +.6 to the mod, and   
   that's it.                                                                  
                                                                               
 * Will run the risk of fatal crashes if I did something dumb. Don't play      
   experimental characters and expect to keep them.                            
                                                                               
 * Will see weird behavior in skills close to zero and close to 50             
                                                                               
 * Will occasionally have to view the skill 'G'ain screen a couple times to    
   see the actual benefits of skill increases                                  
                                                                               
...and, oh:                                                                    
                                                                               
 * Will have skill mod changes retroactively applied to their current skill    
   values                                                                      
                                                                               
#####G For example:                                                            
                                                                               
Let's say you hop into wizard mode, and gives yourself 380 xp, and 200 zeni.   
Poof! You are now level 10, with 54 skill points, and can now experiment with  
two enrollments. You head over to Bob's Kickboxing school, study once, and     
gain:                                                                          
                                                                               
Barehanded 0, +.8                                                              
                                                                               
(Bob tells you you have 1, +.8, but remember skill value changes outside       
of the interface are lost. Deal with it.)                                      
                                                                               
Now, let's raise barehanded to max. You spend 25 skill points, at .8, thus     
bringing your Barehanded skill value to it's maximum for your level: 20,       
and leaving you with 29 skill points.                                          
                                                                               
With your second enrollment, let's now head over to Nakamura's and study       
Karate. Nakamura says he gives you +1, +.6 to barehanded, but in reality       
he's only giving you the modifier, so your total barehanded modifier is        
+1.4. Go to your skill screen, and you'll see that your current barehanded     
skill is 35. That's all 25 of the points you spent previously, at the total    
current mod of 1.4.                                                            
                                                                               
Great, right?                                                                  
                                                                               
#####GBut this has certain implications                                        
                                                                               
You may have noticed that you're now level 10 with a 35 skill. That's fully    
fifteen points over what should be your maximum. But it gets worse, and it     
can be horribly abused. For example...let's start a new character, hop into    
wizard mode with 200 zeni and 380 xp. Now, study Sumo, with only a .3 mod      
in Barehand. You can now spend ALL 54 points, for a net of only 16.2, but      
when you then go and study Kickboxing, and gain an additional .8 mod:          
                                                                               
You are now level 10 with a barehanded skill of 59.4                           
                                                                               
This is just silly. Now, we could:                                             
                                                                               
 * Apply a cap. But that puts people in situations where they have skill       
   points 'locked away' in skills they aren't deriving any benefit from.       
                                                                               
 * Allow these 'already spent' skill points to become magically available      
   again. I don't really like this idea. It doesn't make sense to me.          
                                                                               
 * Limit the number of skill points spent per level. This could possibly       
   solve the problem, but it also creates new ones in the process, and         
   would require that absolutely everything be rebalanced.                     
                                                                               
 * Do away with the whole 'retroactive' part, and simply require that          
   players spend all of their skill points every time they gain a level.       
   This is probably the simplest solution, and would completely solve the      
   original problem, but:                                                      
                                                                               
   * Would require just as much coding as more complicated solutions           
   * Would eliminate the 'save for later' playstyle as even as option          
   * Would create situations where players avoided storyline quests,           
     events and monsters because it made them gain levels before they          
     had opened up skill trees                                                 
   * Creates problems for people who gain multiple levels at a time            
                                                                               
 * Come up with something totally else. Unfortunately this is probably         
   what has to happen.
