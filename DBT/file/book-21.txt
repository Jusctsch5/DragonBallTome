 This is a next-day bugfix release of some assorted silliness that             
 somehow snuck by me for yesterday's release, as well as some fixes            
 for new bug reports on the wiki last night.                                   
                                                                               
 Many thanks to [[[[[GSirrocco] for all the bug reports!

Sunday, Dec 17, 2006 (scant hours after the release of V077)                   
                                                                               
* Argggghhhh!!!! Fixed Imelda's shoe reward AGAIN!!!                           
* You no longer have to talk to Marcos multiple times to get his reward        
  dialogue to increment properly                                               
* You can now construct/disassemble road flares                                
* Korin:                                                                       
        * Implemented Chi training sessions 2 and 3                            
        * Korin now correctly describes his specialty as 'Chi' not 'Defense'   
* Added a Chi spoiler                                                          
* Disabled the North Kaio's house. It appears to be fatal-crash-bugged like    
  Rosshi's. I don't understand why, and it's behaving oddly...and both lcations
  were fine for alpha11. Curiously, if I swap map files, the dungeons work     
  fine, and if I place the maps in another dungeon, they also work fine. This  
  may be an engine bug.                                                        
* Marrying Oolong                                                              
        * Fixed the house. (This worked two days ago. What happened?)          
        * Quest for Marcos now completes properly if you marry Oolong          
        * The dialogue branch that allows you to marry Oolong is now a         
          (Persuade) branch. Sorry ladies...free house and magic weapon        
          with zero risk at level one in thirty seconds was just too           
          much. You can still do it, you'll just need to find a way to         
          get 13 charisma. Shouldn't be difficult. You can even do it          
          at level one or two, you just have to do it on purpose.              
* Pilaf:                                                                       
        * Fixed two more text-overflows (at 24x80) in dialogue                 
        * For the RRA-interuption dialogue path, Mai and Shuu no longer        
          becomes hostile, and the RRA soldiers are no longer prevented        
          from shooting at you                                                 
* Judo/Sumo:                                                                   
        * Multiple friendly duels no longer generate LUA errors                
        * If you actually KILL Yaware or Honda, their schools now close        
        * General cleanup of the Challenge Quests between the two studios

* Customized the Duel vs Sumo map                                              
* Yawara no longer closes her studio if you lose the match with Honda          
  by leaving the ring                                                          
                                                                               
Enjoy!
