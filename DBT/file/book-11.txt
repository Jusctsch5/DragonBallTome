Spanning three different series, and over three hundred episodes,              
Dragonball no doubt has a lot of die-hard loyal fans. Personally,              
I had only ever seen two or three episodes when I started this                 
project. As you can expect, I had a lot of misconceptions about                
the story, the plot, the characters...etc. Dragonball is quite                 
a bit more deep than it appears at first glance. (Or second, or                
third, sometimes. :P )                                                         
In any case, to those fans who dearly love the series, let me                  
extend my apologies for any errors I've made. I've done the best               
I could, with the episodes and guides available to me. I hope you              
enjoy the result.

But it's not entirely my fault! Dragonball has been subbed and                 
dubbed by so many different people over so many years, and there               
are quite a few different interpretations of the show floating                 
around. Just on the surface, it seems like fully half of the                   
characters were given different names by every translator. In some             
cases it's just a matter of romanization. In other cases, it's                 
complicated. Take Dr. Briefs' daughter, for instance. Her original             
Japanese name 'Buruma' is a Japanization of an English word:                   
Bloomers. (To go with the undergarments naming theme of the Breifs'            
family.) Somehow when this was translated back to English dubbing              
though, a lot of translators came up with 'Bulma.' True, if the                
name had originally been 'Bulma' the Japanization of it might                  
have been pretty close to 'Buruma' but it's sort of ironic that                
an English word brought to Japanese would then be romanized                    
rather than simply using the original word. In cases like this                 
I've generally chosen the Japanese name in favor of the English,               
but curiously, lots of characters in Dragonball have names that                
are plays on english words. I've already mentioned Buruma, but                 
what about Vegeta, Radditz, Trunks, Dr. Briefs, Piccolo, Nail...               
it's a long list! There are also a few names that were changed                 
to pacify the american telesion censors. Mr Satan being the                    
most glaringly obvious of those. Yes, there is a character                     
named Mr Satan in Dragonball. Or, 'Hercule' to the american                    
audience. And, similarly, I've chosen to go with 'Hell' instead                
of 'Home for Infinite Losers.' No, sorry...Hell is Hell, Dabura                
is a demon, and Kami is a God. Apparantly the american censors                 
are very sensitive about religious issues, and quite a few                     
characters in Dragonball are Gods or demons. I imagine it must                 
have made the translators life difficult. Often they were able to              
ignore it simply by leaving the Japanese words untranslated.                   
Kami is called Kami instead of God. Chichi is called Chichi intead             
of breasts. Etc.                                                               
                                                                               
In any case, the point of all this is: don't be surprised if you               
see a few place and people names you don't recognize.

#####G(c)Cultural Notes                                                        
Finally, I'd just like to mention some of the cultural issues                  
going on here. Japanese television is generally a lot more                     
lenient about sexual issues than American television. They like                
sex, and are squeemish about death. We like to kill people and                 
are squeemish about sex. It's a bit amusing, really. In any                    
case, yes, Dragonball is a chlidren's television show, but it                  
has an awful lot of material that would never come close to                    
passing American censorship. Oh, sure...some of you are probably               
stil laughing about the 'HELL' --> 'HFIL' nonsense, and if you                 
thought about Dr Briefs, Buruma, Trunks and Bra, you might nod                 
knowingly...but what about some of the actual content of the show?             
Like episode two, where Goku, who has never seen a girl before,                
takes off Buruma's panties and gets all panicky that her balls                 
are missing?  Which conveniently sets her up so when she agrees                
to flip her skirt for Master Rosshi, he gets more than he anticipated?         
For those who have never seen the show...no, Dragonball is not                 
a bizarre sex anime, it's just that Japanese culture is a bit                  
more permissive about this sort of humor. Conversely, an American              
viewer might think it odd that even thought it's apparantly all                
about fighting, there's never any blood in Dragonball, and even                
when characters 'die' it isn't usually more than a temporary                   
inconvenience, and dead characters quite regularly continue on                 
as if nothing had happened. Anyway...the sexual content in                     
Dragonball has created some uncertanties when it's come to                     
module making. If you pay attention when you play, you might see               
some of these themes coming through in an 'americanized' way, but              
don't be shocked if there's still some content which would be                  
blatantly sexual by American standards.                                        
                                                                               
Enjoy!
