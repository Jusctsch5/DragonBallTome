  V088 is a moderately large release, with a broad mix of new content,         
  rulechanges, and bugfixes. Also, a lot of 'old' content that has been        
  disabled for one reason or another has been re-enabled. V088 is about as     
  stable as V087: mostly, but there are a few unresolved bugs.
