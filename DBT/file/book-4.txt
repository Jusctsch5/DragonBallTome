This is an inside look into the various mathematical formulas
and relationships used by Dragonball T. This should save you
some time looking around on killerbunnies. :P


~~~~~1
#####G(b) Stat Bonuses

All primary stats function from a base of 10. At 10, they will
generally neither add, or detract from anything. For every point
above or below, they will affect something by that much. Exceptions
are noted below.

Strength
	Melee Damage Bonus = Str - 10
	Weight Allowance   = Str * 10 lbs.
	Strength is directly added to your digging bonus

Intelligence
	Int - 10 is added to/subtracted from your Total Chi
	Intelligence is directly added to your device success chance

Willpower
	Wil - 10 is added to/subtracted from your Total Chi
	Willpower determines your base "saving throw"
        Willpower > 19 allows a character to continue to function
         after death, as a spirit
        For spirits: Total HP = Willpower * Level

Dexterity
	Dex - 10 is added to your melee to-hit chance
	Dex - 10 is added to your armor class
        Dex is directly added to your chance to avoid pickpockets

Constitution
	Total Hit Point = Constitution * Level

Charisma
Charisma determines your starting money:
	8  Charisma = 0 zeni
	9  Charisma = 50 zeni
	10 Charisma = 100 zeni
	11 Charisma = 500 zeni
	12 Charisma = 1000 zeni

Charisma also modifies the prices you pay when purchasing items
and the amount you receive when selling things, as follow:

With Charisma below 10:
	Every point below ten counts for a 20% price change out of your
	favor (At 1 Charisma, you will pay 280% of regular price)

With Charisma of 10:
	No effect

With Charisma above 10:
	Every point above ten counts for a 1% price change in your favor
	(Yes, at 100 Charisma, everything is FREE)

Speed
	Your general speed rating is equal to your Speed stat - 10

~~~~~2
#####G(b) Miscellaneous

Hit Points: Level * Constitution

Chi = Chi Skill + Intelligence + Willpower
(Or, zero if Chi Skill is < 1)

Base Sanity = Intelligence + Willpower + Level
(Actual sanity may be modified downwards by other factors)

Weight Allowance = Str * 10 pounds


~~~~~3
#####G(c) Combat

Barehanded
	ToHit 1d100 + Barehanded + Dex - 10 Must be >= TargetAC

        Damage = 1 to BarehandedSkill + Str - 10

        AC Bonus = Barehanded

Weapons Combat
	ToHit  (single weapon)
	1d100 + WeaponSkill - WeaponDifficulty + Dex - 10 Must be >= TargetAC

	ToHit  (paired weapons)
	Same as above, but, WeaponDifficulty of the two weapons are multiplied by
	one another, and PairedWeapon skill is subtracted from it. For example,
	katana are not meant to be paired, and have a difficulty of 8. Whipchains
	are also not meant to be paired, and have a difficulty of 10. Thus,
	your net WeaponDifficulty using these two weapons  together would be
	10 * 8 = 80. This penalty is applied to BOTH weapons, and is reduced by
	the parrying skill. With a parry of 20, the penalty would be reduced to
	60. However, parry may never reduce difficulty penalties to less than the
	base difficulty of the weapons involved. Even with 100 skill in parry,
	wielding a katana with a whipchain, you would still have a -8 to-hit with
	the katana and a -10 to hit with the whipchain.

	Damage = WeaponDamage + Str - 10


Armor Class = (Dexterity - 10) + Dodge Skill + TotalACFromEquipment
                + Barehanded bonus + Parry Bonus
