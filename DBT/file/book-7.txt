#####G(a)Weapon Types                                                          
                                                                               
#####BSwords                                                                   
This is an extremely general category describing any of a number               
of weapons of medium length used with one or both hands. Some                  
are bladed, as the katana and ninja-to. Others are not, as the                 
shinai and the bokken.                                                         
                                                                               
#####BPolearms                                                                 
Polearms are essentially big, long sticks which may or may not                 
have something pointy on the end. All polearms require two hands               
to use, but have the benefits of delievring excellent damage while             
at the same time generally beign cheaper than many other weapon                
types. Wood is cheap.                                                          
                                                                               
#####BEntangling Weapons                                                       
Only two weapons qualify as entangling weapons: the whipchain and              
the rope dart. These are amongst the most difficult weapons to use,            
and require two hands. They are capable of delivering tremendous               
damage however, and skilled weapons fighters have a chance of                  
temporarily disabling their opponents with every succesful hit.                
                                                                               
#####BSmall Weapons                                                            
Any small, lightweight weapon which doesn't easily fit into any                
of the other categories is a small weapon. These are generally                 
lightweight, soft-hitting weapons. However, several of them, such              
as the sai and tonfa are designed to be used in pairs, and thus                
allow a fighter to deliver two attacks per round without any                   
to-hit penalties.                                                              
                                                                               
#####BFirearms: Guns                                                           
Coming in both single-hand handguns, as well as two-handed rifles,             
guns may deliver tremendous damage even at range, but only skilled             
marksmen are likely to hit their targets with any frequency.                   
Fortunately, while it is difficult to hit a target, bullets are                
very good at piercing armor.                                                   
                                                                               
#####BFirearms: Rocket Launchers                                               
Any shoulder mounted projectile launcher may be considered a                   
rocket launcher. This class of weapons requires two hands to wield.            
Launchers typically have a single round capacity, and are capable              
of delivering a tremendous amount of damage with area effect.

#####G(b)Special Effects                                                       
Certain weapons have the ability to deliver special effects beyond             
mere damage. These are:                                                        
                                                                               
Whipchain: stun                                                                
Ropedart : stun                                                                
Katana   : cut (Not certain if this is implemented yet...)                     
                                                                               
~~~~~3                                                                         
#####G(c)Poisoning                                                             
Any bladed weapon may have poison applied to it for extra damage.              
One vial of poison will provide enough poison to deliver poison                
damage for anywhere from 5 to 7 applications. As of Version 0.8.0              
poison damage for any attack is equivalent to the amount of the                
melee damage. Meaning, your damage will be DOUBLED for each succesful          
attack.
