The world of Dragonball is fun and exciting and everyone loves it! Yay!

#####G(a) Differences from ToME                                                
                                                                               
The Dragonball T module is very different from the main game in a variety of   
ways.                                                                          
                                                                               
Items                                                                          
Dragonball T is less heavily item dependant than ToME. This is good in that    
you will spend virtually no time "scumming" for useful equipment, but may      
be inconvenient in that a number of items you may be accustomed to simply      
do not exist. Healing potions, Word of Recall and identify scrolls being       
the most conspicuous. Don't worry, though. There are ways of dealing with      
these issues, but Dragonball T handles them differently. Take the time to      
figure them out.                                                               
                                                                               
Character Development                                                          
Rather choosing a class and set of skills right away, in Dragonball T you      
will gradually develop your character over the course of the entire game.      
Skills are generally learned, and improved, in one of two ways: enrolling      
in classes, and completing quests. Which classes you choose to take, and       
which quests you choose to complete will determines what sort of character     
you end up with.                                                               
                                                                               
Combat                                                                         
Dragonball T features an entirely new combat system.                           
                                                                               
Quests                                                                         
Dragonball T is VERY HEAVILY quest and storyline driven. There are             
(present count) over sixty quests which exist in a complicated tree. Some      
are mutually exclusive, many can be solved in several ways, a few can be       
issued by different people for different results, and any combination of       
the above can greatly affect the path that the story takes. Sometimes, even    
merely the sequence in which quests are completed will have storyline          
repercussions. Your first few games you may get used to a certain set of       
quests being available, and then suddenly, one game, find that they are not.   
Don't be surprised by this. Only a very few quests are truly generated         
randomly, but the tree is complicated enough that it may take some time to     
learn.                                                                         
                                                                               
Wilderness or space?                                                           
You may notice that there is no wilderness mode. But oh...wouldn't it be       
wonderful to be able to explore the stars? Hmm. How could you get off of       
this planet?                                                                   
                                                                               
~~~~~2                                                                         
#####G(b) Getting Started                                                      
                                                                               
You begin the game as a complete nobody with aspirations to win the world's    
largest martial arts tournament. Of course, you've never studied martial       
arts, so maybe you should go do that first. There are a number of schools      
available. Choose one you like, and enroll in classes. This will give you      
some basic skills to work with.                                                
                                                                               
From there it's time to start exploring the world. There are a number of       
quests that become available almost immediately, but some of them may be       
too difficult to start on right away. Take your time. Talk to people. Some     
of them may offer useful information.                                          
                                                                               
If you're having difficulty locating low level quests to start with, try       
heading to Aru village, south, and then west of the World Tournament arena.    
Talk to the villagers there. They seem to be having a number of problems.

#####G(c) Feeling Helpless?                                                    
Once you're famliiar with the world, you should be able to start any way       
you'd like, but for the first few times it might help to start out with        
the Dragonball T equivalent of Troll Warrior instead of a Yeek Hermit          
Sorceror. :) Here's my advice for an easy start:                               
                                                                               
str:12                                                                         
int:8                                                                          
wil:8                                                                          
dex:8                                                                          
con:12                                                                         
chr:10                                                                         
spd:12                                                                         
                                                                               
This probably isn't the best long term strategy, but the strength will         
allow you to do damage right away, the constitution will give you a few        
extra hit points, and the speed will help you to run away should you           
ever get in trouble.                                                           
                                                                               
First thing to do, once in game, is to press S and change your movement        
mode to running. With 12 speed stat from above, this should increase your      
net running speed to +5. At that rate you should be able to match speed        
or outrun most things you're likely to encounter on the surface of earth       
Important exception: Mountain lions are fast, and live in the mountains        
to the east of your starting location. If you travel in that direction         
and see a bridge with a sign near it, beware!                                  
                                                                               
After setting your movement rate, your next priority will be choosing          
a martial arts style. There are four schools immediately available in          
the Tonkan business distract a short ways south of your starting location.     
Look for the 4's. Pick a style that suits you, then enroll five times in       
a combat skill class, either barehand or weapons. If you've chosen to          
study weaponry, you might consider investing in a better weapon than the       
kubotan you start with.                                                        
                                                                               
Now, press 'w' to equip your armor (and your weapon if you've enrolled in      
a weapons class) and you're ready to go! You can either pracice with (or       
on, depending on how you look at it) the white and yellow belts in town,       
or you can head for Aru Village to the west and begin working on the           
quests for the villagers there. Imelda's rabbit hole is the > to the           
west of the village.                                                           
                                                                               
Good luck!

#####G(d) Things To Know                                                       
                                                                               
While I've tried to make Dragonball T a lighthearted adventure, I've also      
tried to keep it challenging. I think I've succeeded, but a game should        
be challenging rather than frustrating, so here's some advice and information  
you might want to know:                                                        
                                                                               
#####BDon't skimp charisma                                                     
I know it's awfully tempting to pull as many points from charisma as possible  
during character creation. Feel free, but also know that you may suffer for    
it. Dialogue is a considerable portion of Dragonball T, and as a measure of    
your ability to convince people to like you and see things your way, charisma  
will frequently affect which dialogues options are available to you. You can   
always equip charisma enhancing items, and/or increase your skill directly     
by studying at the Robbins Institute.                                          
                                                                               
#####BOh no! I lost a really important quest item!                             
Dont' worry about it. There may be some quests that will become unfinishable   
without the right items, but the game should never be irrecoverable because    
of it. You might just have to find an alternate solution for the problem.      
Also, in particular, Dragonballs may never be permanently lost.  Even if       
you abandon a dragonball on a level somewhere, it will always be possible      
to find it again at a later date.                                              
                                                                               
#####BI don't think I want to do that                                          
Then DON'T. Just because someone issues you a quest doesn't mean you should    
do it. Be willing to pick and choose what you're willing to do. Even if        
you've already accepted a quest, you can always change your mind. Failing      
a quest is not always a bad thing. In fact, there are some branches on the     
quest tree that are only accessible if you fail certain quests, and it is      
even possible to be simultaneously issued multiple quests which directly       
contradict one another. Don't feel like you have to play a certain way         
just because someone issues you a quest. Play as you like. That's why          
there are multiple game endings.                                               
                                                                               
#####BChange your playstyle                                                    
Without going into too much detail, there are five primary professional        
styles available in Dragonball T. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses,   
and some may be better able to cope with the challenges you face. If you're    
having a tough time, try things differently. Perform different quests. Try     
to solve one ones you have in different ways. Develop new skills and see how   
the game changes for you. It may help. It may also enhance replayability. If   
you play exactly the same way every game, you'll see the same story. Do        
things differently, and you'll have a different game experience.               
                                                                               
Good luck!
