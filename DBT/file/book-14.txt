#####G(a)Hello!
This is the fourth unoffical public release. We like unnofficial
releases. They are our friend. This particular release is...
shall we say...not entirely stable. Lots of new material, and
it's starting to get to the point where it's difficult for me
to try all the permutations of everything I'm generating. But
that's where bugtesting comes in. In particular, the Pilaf
and Rosshi dialogues are likely to generate LUA errors, and/or
display errors. If you get yourself into trouble, try executing
'term.load()' from wizard mode, and it may allow you to recover.
Otherwise, I *think* things are mostly ok...

#####G(b)Noteworthy Changes since Version 0.4.2
Wow...lots of things.
0) Dragonball T has been upgraded to the new alpha5
1) Lots of new quests and uniques
2) A couple new dungeons and special levels
3) The Red Ribbon Army is no longer wimpy. No more going into
Muscle Tower at level one and making level 10 in three minutes.
4) Totally new ID system! Yay! Experiment with it! It's nifty!
5) Completely revamped the Chi system, but it's largely
inaccessible right now.
6) Totally new dialogue system. Much coolness, but odds are
good only people who have worked with it will notice the
difference. Basically the new system allows four things:
 a) You can both talk to and attack the same people
 b) I can call any function I want from within dialogue
 c) There can be dialogue responses which are hidden based
 on any criteria I want
 d) Multiple people can now talk within the same dialogue.
 Check out Pilaf to see this in action.
7) With the new dialogue system comes over 50K worth of new
dialogue.
8) Bugs reported by NerdanelVampire on the Wiki *should*
now be fixed.
9) Nifty new splash screens, which you've probably already
seen. :)
10) The afterlife has been partially, loosely implemented.

#####G(c)Known Bugs
1) Kami's Lookout is broken. Don't go there.
2) Rosshi, Pilaf and Briefs' dialogues are all a bit skecthy.
Pilaf's is healthy enough to play with...Rosshi is about 50/50
going to end your game, Briefs' has some issues.
3) LUA errors if you ever try to create a second character.
I don't know why.

#####G(d)To Submit a Bug Report
If convenient, submit bug reports for Dragonball T on the wiki.
I've created a bug report section on the DBT page. That should
be a little easier than navigating the official bug report forum.
If you don't feel comfortable with the Wiki feel welcome to submit
via email to lordbucket@hotmail.com.

Enjoy!
