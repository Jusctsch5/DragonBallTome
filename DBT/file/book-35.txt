Summary:

#####G(a) Status                                                               
Version 0.9.1                                                                  
                                                                               
And so it came to pass that V091 of Dragonball T was released.                 
                                                                               
Please note: Over the past four months since V090 was released,                
there have been some long stretches where no development has                   
actually been done. In particular, at one point I didn't even                  
so much as look at DBT for almost five weeks. Consequently,                    
when going through the changelog I notice that there are a few                 
things that I don't actually remember doing. Also some things                  
that I remember doing, but don't remember quite finishing...                   
even though the changelog implies that they were finished.                     
                                                                               
As usual, I am aware of no fatal crashes or game ending behavior               
as of time of release, but it's quite possible that there may                  
be some awkward loose ends that didn't quite get tied up all                   
nice and neat.                                                                 
                                                                               
That having been said, hopefully there are some nice new things                
to play with.                                                                  
                                                                               
Enjoy!

#####G(b) Summary of Changes:                                                  
                                                                               
Systems:                                                                       
 * Stores now refresh                                                          
 * The cloth-type item enhancement system has been                             
   heavily clarified                                                           
                                                                               
New Content:                                                                   
 * Roughly 60K of new dialogue                                                 
 * The Ninjutsu Challenge quest has been implemented                           
 * New ego type: Wildly inaccurate                                             
 * New items: scopes, cloth, scissors, single and double                       
   barreled shotguns, scattershot, lead slugs, capsule boats                   
 * Buruma may now encapsulate and carry objects for the player                 
 * The Buddhist Temple has been converted into a late-early                    
   game dungeon of levels 17-23. New dialogue, monsters and                    
   quests accompany this.                                                      
 * New quest: Save the Temple                                                  
 * Several more (but not all) marriage permutations are now                    
   possible amongst Oolong, Rosshi, Chichi, Videl, Lunch and                   
   Buruma. If you think it might work, try it. It might.                       
 * It is now possible for male characters to get training                      
   from Rosshi. There may be more solutions than is                            
   immediately obvious.                                                        
                                                                               
Rulechanges and Balance:                                                       
 * Any player who makes it to level 25 may now survive death                   
   as a spirit                                                                 
 * Increased Kungfu parrying skill gains from 1.2 to 1.5                       
   Increased kungfu paired skill gains from 1.5 to 2.0                         
 * As per Sirrocco's suggestion, certain monster changes                       
   have been made to create a broader variety of monster                       
   'danger' relative to monster 'sturdiness.' There are now                    
   some monsters which are quite deadly, but relatively easy                   
   to kill, as well as monsters which are not very                             
   dangerous, but hard to kill.                                                
 * Krillan has been made much less powerful, and is no longer                  
   a trainer. The temple Abbot takes his place as Chi Master.                  
 * Dungeon item drop quantities have been generally reduced,                   
   and in some cases eliminated. Monster drop quantities have                  
   generally been increased. This should reduce incentive for                  
   stair scumming in palces like Mr. Satan's Estate.                           
 * Gym and library no longer accept "donations" from members                   
                                                                               
                                                                               
Firearms:                                                                      
 * New firearms: shotuns, double barreled shotguns                             
   Shotguns fire all loaded rounds in volleys                                  
   high capacity double barreled shotgun = LOTS of damage                      
 * New shotgun ammo: scattershot, lead slug                                    
 * Implemented semi/fully automatic toggles for machine                        
   guns. While firing at range while in fully automatic mode,                  
   a machine gun will fire a five round burst, with each round                 
   targetting any of the nine spaces within one space of the                   
   intended target. Shots fired at point blank range are                       
   targetted normally.                                                         
 * Scopes have been implemented. Any firearm with a scope                      
   is treated as being five spaces closer to target for                        
   range penalties. Thus, anything up to five spaces away is                   
   terated as point blank range, a target at seven spaces                      
   would be treated as if at only two, etc.                                    
 * Firearm subsystem can now handle variable reload types                      
 * Damage information is now more properly stored in                           
   ammunition rather than firearms. Consequently, each                         
   individual ammo SVAL may now specify its own damage                         
   range, type and area of effect                                              
 * Fixed AP. Only armor piercing ammo will reduce targets                      
   AC in half.                                                                 
 * Migrated FIXED_PROJ weapons to LOOKUP_PROJ                                  
 * Firearms now indicate what type of ammo they have loaded                    
   when inspected                                                              
 * Machine guns may now toggle between single burst and                        
   fully automatic firing modes                                                
 * Firearm range, damage and ammo capacities have generally                    
   been increased                                                              
 * New firearm ego: wildly inaccurate                                          
                                                                               
New issues:                                                                    
 * Inspecting ammunition really should indicate whether it is                  
   armor piercing. (AP clips and lead slugs may peirce armor)                  
 * Krillan has been toned down, but his placement in the World                 
   Tournament has remained the same. Consequently you may get                  
   a really easy final match.                                                  
                                                                               
Bugfixes:                                                                      
 * Trunks training updated to the enrollment system                            
 * Kinto Un now leaves when removed (Gah! Hours!!!)                            
 * Random items may now receive pluses again                                   
 * Items should auto-id again                                                  
 * There should be no more double egos, though I've never seen one so it's     
   difficult for me to check                                                   
 * Inventory letters for ego items should now always highlight in blue         
 * I belive I have fixed issues relating to ego and artifact generation        
 * It is once again possible to enroll in ninjutsu                             
 * Fixed some screen corruptions relating to Oolong's marriage                 
 * Disarming traps no longer causes your strength skill to increase            
 * Corrected Sakura's misleading challenge dialogue                            
 * Applied NerdanelVampire's add_flag fix, thus fixing fur-lined, studded      
   and designer egos. Ego bonuses now ''add'' instead of ''replace'' item      
   bonuses                                                                     
 * Updated some quest descriptions that were still using the alpha14           
   convention                                                                  
 * Fixed an error relating to Trunks' enrollment                               
 * Applied EtMarc's solution for FS#108. It seems to work! Yay! :)             
 * Fixed a LUA error in Yamcha's AI                                            
 * Fixed: Can eat from corpses again                                           
 * Fixed: can no longer eat from a corpse infinitely many times                
 * Fixed: The 'z' LUA error bug                                                
 * Fixed: Imelda now properly gives desinger shoes, when appropriate           
 * It is now possible to train/speak/challenge the Ninja instructor            
 * Entering stores should no longer occassionally generate LUA errors now      
 * Ahhhaaa!!!! Fixed the LUA error in the Foot Lair                            
 * Fixed Tenshinhan and Chaozu's AI's                                          
 * Fixed a screen corruption in Videl's dialogue                               
 * ...and I quote from the change log... "Fixed a bunch of stuff that was      
   broken."                                                                    
                                                                               
                                                                               
Enjoy!
