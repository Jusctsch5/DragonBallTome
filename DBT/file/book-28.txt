#####G(a)Unstable Release!

#####y the win.cfg file in .tome/3.0/settings!                                 
                                                                               
 V085 is not entirely stable. Alpha14 has changed a LOT of things. Some        
 for the better, so maybe not so much. And, unfortuantely, in some cases       
 features that Dragonball T was making heavy use of have been completely       
 removed from the engine. In any case, the upgrade has been very slow,         
 and IS NOT COMPLETE as of this release. I recommend backing up your save      
 files.                                                                        
                                                                               
 But, this aside, this release does have some nifty features, and significant  
 revisions to both Chi and Technomancy. Perhaps not as complete as I would     
 have liked, but it is what it is.                                             
                                                                               
 Enjoy!

#####G(b)Summary of Changes                                                    
Systems:

 * Implemented ranged to-hit penalties for firearms                            
 * Slight development of ammo system                                           
 * Dialogue no longer reveals 'hidden' dialogue options                        
                                                                               
Bugfixes:                                                                      
 * Killing Kami now correctly renders the dragonballs useless                  
 * Fixed the 'capsule ego item' weight bug                                     
 * Secret door in Orinji Temple is now 'secret'                                
 * High Tech Components are now flavored                                       
 * It is now possible to recharge maglights                                    
 * Rapiers are now bladed                                                      
 * One of the two Steel ego weapon bugs has fixed (I think)                    
   Weird steel items will still spawn, but fantastically overpowered           
   "+200" weapons shouldn't be generated. (Again...I think.)                   
 * Hasuki and Bear Thief quests should work properly now                       
 * Lite source fuel use should be more consistent now                          
 * Gym/Library allowances/quest notices now at correct character levels        
 * Jacque no longer sells to non-students                                      
 * Uniques no longer resist disintegration                                     
 * Capsules may no longer be encapsulated                                      
 * Chi constant effects may no longer be set negative to induce regeneration   
 * Fixed two somewhat obscure fatal crash bugs                                 
 * Fixed the White Wolf quest                                                  
 * Fixed the 'drop item in house' bug                                          
                                                                               
Rulechanges/Balance:                                                           
 * Significant changes to Technomancy and Chi. Both have received significant  
   power level upgrades, rebalancing, and some rule changes. Reading the       
   release notes and/or spoilers is recommended.                               
 * First aid kits are now deeper items. Blood coagulant takes their place.     
   Coagulant is 'used up' when used. First aid kits are not.                   
 * Barehanded ability requirements have been lowered                           
 * Armor Piercing ballistic effect now only applies to Armor Piercing ammo     
 * Eating corpses now potentially incurs alignment loss/poison effects         
 * The experience ladder is more intelligent, and that terrible wall around    
   levels 25-30 is gone                                                        
 * All devices that previously required abilities are now usable by characters 
   with sufficient Technology skill (motorcycles, first aid kits, guns, etc)   
   and the list of items reserved exclusively to Technomancers has grown. See  
   the spoilers. Note that the check only considers actual skill, not whether  
   you' re formally a Technomancer. Thus, it would be possible (though         
   innefficient) for a player to gain these benefits via Dragonball wishes.    
                                                                               
New Content:                                                                   
 * New Items: Capsule Spaceships, nailguns, nails, zheng gu shui,              
   blood coagulant, grenades, shuriken, jackhammer, white and brown rice       
   regular and heavy turtle shells                                             
 * New maps: Fencing Duel, Lair of the Phoenix, Duel vs Judo                   
 * New Option: "Prevent reload until ammo is empty"                            
 * Some development of planet Namek. probably not enough to warrant the trip   
   yet, though.                                                                
 * New unique: Giran                                                           
 * Substantial development of the Volcano                                      
 * There is now a hotel at the airport that anyone can stay overnight at       
 * A few new spoilers have been added                                          
                                                                               
chi changes:                                                                   
 * chi pool = Willpower * chi skill. Intelligence is no longer a factor.       
 * All math, anywhere, having anything to do with chi has had a 'going over'   
 * Implemented damage absorbtion                                               
 * Implemented chi based spaceflight                                           
 * New ability: Aura light                                                     
 * Lite radius from battle aura now increases with the size of your chi pool   
                                                                               
Misc:                                                                          
 * Dr Tofu now stocks items he reasonably should

#####G(c)Issues relating to migrating DBT to alpha14                           
 * Special attack types don't register in monster memory                       
 * Armor display is weird                                                      
 * Verbose descriptions of *ID*'d items sometimes do not display correctly.    
   In particular, Technomancers using laptops may have issues.                 
 * Tunneling not implemented                                                   
 * win.cfg causes crashes after a game has been saved                          
 * No FEAT functions have been migrated to the new cave flag function metho    
   So far as I can tell, this new alpha14 feature simply doesn't work.         
 * FLAG_PERSISTENT has been removed from the engine, so I've replaced about    
   fifteen maps that were using it with SAVE_LEVEL=true. Consequently some     
   WEIRD stuff  is going to happen in regards to special levels.               
 * Knowledge menu has not been DBT'ified                                       
 * map.level_size_to_map() has not been added                                  
                                                                               
~~~~~4                                                                         
#####G(d)General Newly observed Issues:                                        
 * Wizard mode cureall no longer restores chi                                  
 * Technomancers really do need to be able to make ego items <sigh>            
 * Not possible to have missile ball effects of variable radius                
 * "Beam" weapons don't actually "beam"                                        
 * Scopes need to be implemented                                               
 * It is not possible for ammo to specify the ball/bolt/beam type              
 * It would be neat to have the chi light effects of evil players radiate      
   red                                                                         
 * Chi constant effects turn off when chi pool < 1, not <= 0, which is not     
   quite the same                                                              
 * If you are removed from the ring by Giran's tailwhip, you're not            
   disqualified *properly*                                                     
 * Looks like some dialogue paths of the Trunks early Android option has some  
   issues
