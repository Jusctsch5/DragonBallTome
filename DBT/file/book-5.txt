Acupuncture is the fine art of poking holes in someone with extremely thin     
needles in order to alter the flow of energy of energy through the body        
generally for the purpose of healing.

While acupuncture is an excellent means of curing most secondary effects,      
such as blindness, confusion, poison, cuts, and even stat loss, it may not     
be used to heal physical damage, nor to restore mental conditions such as      
fatigue or insanity.

To perform acupuncture, you will need a set of acupuncture needles,            
available at any acupuncture clinic. Dr. Tofu runs such a clinic near          
Capsule Corporation headquarters. You will also need to be at least            
relatively versed in the art.

Chi is life. Misuse of Chi can result in death. Experimentation by those       
unfamliar with the art is extremely dangerous. The casual practitioner may     
be partially effective on occassion, but may also cause slight injury. Only    
an experienced practitioner will be assured of success.

Acupuncture may be performed by 'u'sing a set of acupuncture needles. If       
there is any possibility of injury, you will be asked to confirm the           
attempt.
