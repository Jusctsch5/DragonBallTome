#####G(a)Hello!                                                                
After a week and a half I still haven't done everything I had                  
planned for Version 050, but at least thing are a little more                  
stable now. I'm not aware of any crashes or screen weirdnesses                 
with this relase, but altogether Dragonball T is really starting               
to get kind of huge. It's well past the stage where I can                      
realistically just keep a mental picture of where everything is                
and what's going ona ll the time...so bug reports are going to                 
start becoming increasingly important as time goes on.                         
                                                                               
~~~~~2                                                                         
#####G(b)Noteworthy Changes since Version 0.5.0                                
Wow...lots of things.                                                          
1) Capsules have been implemented. I hightly recommend you                     
pull up wizard mode and play with them. Not a *big* deal,                      
but capsules were a MAJOR thematic component in Dragonball,                    
and I'm pleased I was able to include them.                                    
2) Basic implementation of vehicles. Also not a *big* deal,                    
but kind of neat. Really, only the motorcycle does anything                    
yet, but you might play with them just for fun. Excellent                      
item to be encapsulated, too.                                                  
3) A couple new uniques, several new quests, a couple                          
new special levels, one new dungeon, about about 40K of                        
new dialogue.                                                                  
4) The data strcture of...well, everything has been                            
redesigned so that things are slightly more well organized.                    
This will mostly be invisible to the player, but it should                     
fix save-game issues. Feel free to reuse your old savefiles                    
now.                                                                           
5) One of the five possible game endings is now availale.                      
As in...it is actually possible to beat the game. Don't get                    
too hopeful though, of the five, the one that works is the                     
'joke' ending. :P                                                              
6) Freeza's Planet 79 now exists, though it's a dead end                       
plotline at the moment.                                                        
7) Technology for non-technologists is now functional.                         
8) Enough miscellanous 'stuff' has been done that the                          
todo list is down to 9K! Wow!

#####G(c)Known Bugs                                                            
1) Several dialogues still have dead-ends: Rosshi, Pilaf,                      
Dr. Gero and Dr. Briefs. I really need to finish these.                        
Once they're done...the game is largely playable up to                         
about character level 35. It is now, it's just that if                         
you happen to choose an incomplete dialogue, half the                          
time is breaks your quest chain...and while you could                          
keep playing, personally I have a tough time playing                           
when the quest tree is broken.

#####G(d)To Submit a Bug Report                                                
If convenient, submit bug reports for Dragonball T on the wiki.                
I've created a bug report section on the DBT page. That should                 
be a little easier than navigating the official bug report forum.              
If you don't feel comfortable with the Wiki feel welcome to submit             
via email to lordbucket@hotmail.com.
