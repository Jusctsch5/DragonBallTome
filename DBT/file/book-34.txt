Version 0.9.0                                                                  
                                                                               
 Phew! This past month has gone by quickly. Alpha18 hasn't come,               
 and a lot of engine bugs remain. I've tried to work around some               
 and ignored some others. V090 is not nearly as grandiose as was               
 planned, but still features some nice new content.                            
                                                                               
 Also, I think it's time to start making some spoilers. As Reenen              
 pointed out a while back, there's a lot of content her in DBT                 
 that noone has ever seen. That's good, at that the middle and late            
 game will continue to hold surprises for a long while, but it's               
 sad that people aren't getting to see it. Hopefully as more middle            
 game material becomes available it will be easier to survive to               
 the late game.

#####G(b) NOTE:                                                                
NOTE: A few days before release some very bad things happened to               
Dragonball T, which unfortunately involved some reverts of some                
rather important files (like the dialogue file). Some things                   
are not entirely back in place. This version must, sadly, be                   
considered "not entirely stable" and some things that are reported             
as completed in the change logs may have been lost. We do the best             
we can.                                                                        
                                                                               
I am aware of no major errors...but I have not completely reviewed             
everything I've done over the past month. There are very likely to             
be some LUA errors and/or screen corruptions. As usual, dialogue               
related display problems can usually be cleared by saving and reloading.       
When in doubt, wizard mode is ctrl-W

   MOVE_POST_DEST function                                                     
 * Ego items never generate                                                    
 * Kami's Lookout is broken

New issues:                                                                    
 * It is possible to encapsulate integrated capsule items while equipped       
   This shouldn't be meaningfully abusable, since speed is unaffected by       
   weight while riding/piloting, but it is incorrect                           
 * It shouldn't be possible to enter stores while flying at high altitude      
 * Chi Bursts need a "you hit it" message. Monsters who fail to reflect        
   or deflect blasts should generate failure messages.                         
 * Attack messages for party members seems to be invisible, though it appears  
   in scrollback
