Note: As of DBT Version 0.3.0 the analysis offered
herein is no longer representative of the current
combat system. Eventually a proper comparison will
be offered, but for now, let me summarize by saying
that weapons do more damage, but barehanded hits more
often. It's a lot more complicated than that, but if
you're having difficulty fighting barehanded in the
early game, don't be adverse to switching to weapons.
I've seen a second level character with zero skill take
on a level 7 black belt.

#####G(a) Barehanded
Barehanded combat is very simple, and straightforward
in both its use, and its skill point investment. By
investing points in the barehanded skill, a player will
receive bonuses to their chances to-hit, their damage
as well as their armor class. Additional points spent
in the general martial arts skill will further increase
their to-hit chances.

Barehand fighting does have its limitations, though.
While a barehanded fighter will generally have an easy
time hitting a target, they may not deliver a lot of
damage. Maximum damage for barehand is equal to the
vaule of your barehanded skill, plus any strength
bonuses. THis means that many players will find
themselves unable to do more than one or two points
of damage at a time. Some players may even be incapable
of damaging a target at all. This problem quickly
goes away with the investment of a few skill points,
however.

The other disadvatage to barehanded fighting is the
inability to wield anything in your hands. Both hands
must be completely free to fight barehanded. This means
a barehanded fighter must make special allowances
for adventuring in dark places, as flashlights must
be carried in the hands.

#####G(b) Weapons
Weapons offer easy damage at the expense of difficulty
of use, and a lessened chance of successfully landing a
blow. They offer a great deal more flexibility than
barehanded fighting, as a weapons fighter may choose
from any of nearly two dozen weapons, and may even
choose to wield two entirely different weapons together.
Doing so often results in a severe to-hit penalty, but
this may be mitigated either by choosing weapons which
naturally pair, or by investing points in the paired
weapons skill, which reduces this penalty. Poor choice
of weapons may result in a penalty as high as -80
to-hit. It would require 80 skill points to make up for
such a penalty.

Futher, weapons fighting is altogether more skill point
intensive than barehand, with four separate skills to
invest points in: martial arts, which increases only
your tohit odds, weapons, which also increases your
tohit odds, as well as determines your chances of success
in weapon-related tasks, parrying, which provodes an armor
class bonus for each weapon wielded, and paired, which
reduces paired weapon penalties.

Weapons combat also offers a variety of other benefits:
A weapons fighter may cary things in his hands (such as
flashlights) and continue to fight, some weapons can
have poison applied to them, many weapons offer benefits
secondary to their immediate combat value. Entangling
weapons may disable foes, some may offer resistance or
protective benefit, and of course, there are any artifact
weapons which offer any number of benefits.

#####G(c) Comparitive Analysis
For the first several levels, weapons combat
is always superior to barehand. A fighter with average
stats and no skill may be able to land blows more often
with his hands, but we will do virtually no damage,
whereas a weapon can easily be made to deliver a goodly
amount.

As the game progresses, barehanded will usually
overtake weapons as the superior choice, because the
damage limitations of barehanded will drop off far
more quickly than than the average player will be
able to afford to upgrade his weapons. This, in
addition to the skill point expenditures, which will
allow a barehanded fighter to be as effective as a
weapons fighter with three times as many skill points
invested.

By the middle game, a barehanded fighter will have
found solutions to the light problem, but may begin
to regret his inability to wield the artifacts he
is beginning to find. This may or may not be
outweighed by all the skill points he has available
to invest, depending primarily on playstyle.

In the late game, the evaluation becomes more complicated,
as many factors are involved. However, the deciding
factor may often be that of skill points. A barehanded
fighter needs only reach 200 combined skill in martial
arts and barehand in order to have reached his maximum
capacity. A weapons fighter, however, might spend up to
400. 100 each in martial arts, weapons, parrying and
paired. His ultimate end result will be far more impressive,
but at twice the cost.
