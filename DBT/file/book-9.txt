#####GIntroduction                                                             
There are four types of conventional firearms in Dragonball T.                 
(As well as a few unconventional ones.) These are:                             
                                                                               
 * Guns                                                                        
 * Machine guns                                                                
 * Shotguns                                                                    
 * Missile launchers                                                           
                                                                               
#####GGuns                                                                     
Weapons of this class are designed to fire a single round                      
every time you pull the trigger. They come in two varieties:                   
'pistols' which are wielded in one hand, and do the least                      
damage and have the shortest range of any firearm, and 'rifles'                
which require two hands two fire, but have slightly better                     
range. Guns may be reloaded to full capacity with any standard                 
or armor piercing clip.                                                        
                                                                               
#####GShotguns                                                                 
Shotguns are firearms into which rounds are loaded directly into               
the chamber rather than via clips. Typically, shotguns come in                 
single and double barreled varieties. Each round must be loaded                
into the barrel one at a time, and when the weapon is fired, any               
and all loaded rounds are discharged at once. Shotguns may be                  
loaded with scattershot, or lead slugs. Scatershot rounds contain              
dozens of thin slivers of metal which burst into an area effect.               
Lead slugs fire like regular ammunition, but with an armor piercing            
effect.                                                                        
                                                                               
#####GMachine Guns                                                             
Machine guns are designed to fire in either of two modes. Semi-automatic       
mode, in which only a single bullet is fired each time the trigger is          
pulled, and fully-automatic mode, in which a burst of several rounds is        
fired every time the trigger is pulled. This flexibility does come at a        
cost, however, and machine guns are not very accurate weapons. All rounds      
fired from a machine gun will go in 'approximately' the direction they         
are aimed. In practice, every round will be fired at a square plus or minus    
one from the intended target. So, each round has only a one in nine chance     
of going where you want it to go.                                              
                                                                               
     ...                                                                       
  @  .t.                                                                       
     ...                                                                       
                                                                               
When firing on t, each bullet may actually be aimed at not only the t,         
but also any of the .'s instead. Of course, the bullets will travel in         
straight lines, and so may end up hitting your target even if they're          
not targetted to the correct square. In any case, stray bullets may hit        
targets in the vicinity. Machine guns may be toggled between semi-automatic    
and fully-automatic modes via the 'u'se command, but will be similarly         
inaccurate in both modes.                                                      
                                                                               
#####GMissile Launchers                                                        
Missile lauunchers are two-handed, shoulder-mounted weapons which              
may be used to fire missiles. Missiles are extremely high-damage,              
area-effect, and may tend to do unpleasant things to the surrounding           
terrain. It will generally only be possible load a single missile              
at a time into any launcher, but that single missile will do loads             
of damage.                                                                     
                                                                               
#####GArmor Piercing Ammunition                                                
Armor piercing ammo is especially good at penetrating heavy armor,             
even tank armor. AP rounds are generally built as solid slug of                
metal. This causes them to deeply penetrate rather than shattering             
upon impact. This has the effect of halving the effective armor                
class of the target, but since they tend merely to poke holes rather           
than tear cone-shaped chunks, they tend to do less damage than                 
ordinary rounds. Standard clips which are armor piercing will be               
designated (AP). Also, all shotgun lead-slugs are considered armor             
piercing as well.                                                              
                                                                               
#####GHow are to-hit chances computed for firearms?                            
Your to-hit bonus for firearms will be equal to your skill                     
in Marksmanship. Armor piercing ammunition will divide the targets             
armor class in half. Martial arts skill and dexterity do not                   
effect your chances to hit with any firearm.                                   
                                                                               
#####GRange                                                                    
It is more difficult to hit targets at a distance. When firing on any          
target not immediately adjacent, a range to-hit penalty will be applied        
equal to the square of the distance beyond one. Thus, a target two spaces      
away will have a -1 penalty to hit. A target three spaces away will have       
a -4 penalty.                                                                  
                                                                               
 Distance Penalty

  10       810

  12       121                                                                 
                                                                               
As you can see, it rapidly becomes extremely difficult to hit anything         
the further away it is. However, many firearms may have scopes fitted          
to them. Scope reduce the effective distance by their magnification            
factor. This is applied directly to the distance, rather than being            
subtracted from the penalty. So, a firearm fitted with a scope with            
a magnification of 5 would fire as if five spaces closer to any target.        
A target seven spaces away would be treated as if only two spaces away,        
and thus only receive a -1 penalty to hit.
