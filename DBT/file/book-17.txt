#####G(a)Hello!                                                                
                                                                               
    Due to recent computer sillynes, and a general inability for me to         
    download the latest alpha8, it's been three weeks since the last           
    release. Consequently, this has turned out to be a VERY BIG relase         
    ith a lot of changes. Unfortuantely, I'm still running alpha7, and         
    there are a few bugfixes in alpha8 that Dragonball T really needs.         
    Hopefully this release will run adequently on alpha8, but without          
    the ability to test it, at the moment, I can't say for sure it will        
    even load. If you have difficulty, run it with alpha7.

#####G(b)Version Numbering Change                                              
                                                                               
  Up to Dragonball T V.0.6.6 I had been using a policy of 'if I work           
  on DBT that day, I increment the version number.' Unfortuantely while        
  some 'days' I'm able to spend hours, others 'days' are only twenty           
  minutes, and I found myself rapidly running out of version numbers.          
  So startign with this release, official version numbers are 'what I          
  feel like' rather than number of days worked. I'll include both              
  just for continuity. While this release is numbered V0.7.2 it would          
  be 0.8.7 by the old system.
