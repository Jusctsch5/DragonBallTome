 Merry Christmas, everyone! As the version number indicates, this is not       
 a huge release. Only a couple bugfixes, but 079 is mostly about weapons.      
 and the experimental skill option. Read on.

--------------------------------------------                                   
                                                                               
 * New experimental skill system                                               
 * New experimental aplication of th/dam/ac bonuses on treasure drops.         
   This has not been officially introduced by the engine yet, and I'm          
   'winging it' to get it to happen. Odd things may result.                    
 * Motorcycle rebalancing and bugfixes                                         
 * Weapon changes:                                                             
   * Implemented entangling/vorpal weapons                                     
   * The swordsmith can rebalance blades for + to hit                          
   * Two new weapon special abilities: Iaido and Bleed Attack                  
   * You may fight with a gun/melee weapon from a motorcycle at -30 tohit      
 * Mr. Satan no longer teaches double attack                                   
 * Briefs general cleanup and rearrangement                                    
 * Bugfixes: No more Briefs 'unknown object' bug, dragonballs are now 'used'   
 * Temporary workaround for the alpha12 dungeon bug regarding Rosshi

* Edits to the Mr Satan dialogue. Things have been rearranged. Don't count     
  on the old dialogue rewards to be exactly what they used to be. Mr. Satan    
  is a comic relief character. He longer teaches double attack. Other changes  
  have been made as well. At the moment, it is still possible to talk him      
  into giving you a dragonball, but this might change in the future.           
* Alignment loss for evil dialogue choices have generally been increased       
* Rule Change: If your alignment is less than -99, killing evil uniques no     
  longer increases your alignment                                              
* added about 7K dialogue

* World Tournament trophy is now ID'd                                          
* It is now possible to complete the Briefs Tournament quest                   
* General cleanup, rearrangement, and rebalancing of some of the quests        
  for Dr Briefs. For example:                                                  
        * No random quests issues while Martial Arts Delivery Service          
          is pending                                                           
        * If you use Briefs to gain access to the Satan Estate, you no         
          longer also receive Tech skills gains for the accompanying quest     
        * If you fail the delivery quest, you can no longer receive random     
          quests                                                               
        * Etc                                                                  
        * Note: The Briefs Ballistic Bodyarmor quest tree is, and has          
          ALWAYS been intended to be entirely mutually exclusive with          
          the ENTIRE Briefs Tech branch. Even so, there have been              
          several changes since the armor was introduced that probably         
          make it unreasonably powerful. Muscle Tower is level 20-26           
          instead of 10-15, and several uniques now exist who do slash         
          damage. Might have to reconsider this one.                           
                                                                               
* Nakamura no longer teaches Martial Arts Sushi eating. If you already         
  know Double Attack, instead, he increases your Barehand skill by +3, +.2     
* Fixed the 'error in Briefs random quest' bug. Curiously, looking at          
  the code, the bug should have popped up in 10% of all type 1 random quests   
* Dialogue development of Videl and Buruma (incomplete, commented out          
  in this release)

* Roads and buildings in town are now lit (Ack! Doesn't work!)                 
* Tuxedo's now increase charisma by 2

* Made gold drops slightly more common in dungeons                             
* Basic Implementation of tohit/dam/ac bonuses on random treasure drops        
* ID Checking now occurs for every item at time of creation                    
* Implemented Iaido                                                            
* Set of price mods by th/d/ac bonuses, but hook(OBJECT_VALUE appears          
  not to function                                                              
* Tofu Sensei now properly teaches Acupuncture                                 
* Updated a few of the book-n.txt parchments. (Several are OLD dating          
  from DBT 3.x!)                                                               
* Swordsmith:                                                                  
        * Can now 're-balance' blades for to-hit bonuses                       
        * May sharpen/balance to +1 starting at level 1, not at level 5        
* Weapons:                                                                     
        * Eliminated the 'can be used with two hands' display. It's not        
          being used.                                                          
        * Fixed the poisoned weapon description                                
        * A single poison application now grants 5-7 uses, instead of 1-3      
* Trunks will now teach the Paired Weapons ability to anyone, for free,        
  provided they have a weapon skill of 50 or more                              
* Implemented stunning effects from entangling weapons

* Weapons:                                                                     
        * Implemented vorpal weapons                                           
        * New ability: Bleed attack                                            
        * Weapons abilities now have skill minimums                            
* New item: Ofuda                                                              
* Musashi is now a unique and has his own cave                                 
* ...added monster_effects...?                                                 
* Pffft. Dropped the Ring of Fire quest to level 16. You can walk right        
  through the flames with 10 constitution and zero fire resistance at          
  level 15. (Still can't get credit for completing the quest)                  
* It is now possible to raise/lower the drawbridge at Ox Castle

* Yep...the dungeon crashing situation is definitely an engine bug.            
  Set up a bizarre workaround for ROsshi's Kame house                          
* Motorcycles/Vehicles:                                                        
        * It is no longer possible to fight barehanded from a                  
          motorcycle                                                           
        * No AC bonuses from barehand or Dodge while riding                    
        * Only your right hand must be empty to ride                           
        * It IS now possible to fight with a single weapon or a                
          firearm from a motorcycle                                            
        * Doing so conveys a -30 to hit penalty                                
        * Vehicles may no longer navigate level transitions                    
        * You may no longer pick things up with riding (Except                 
          gold, for now...)                                                    
        * Motorcycles now provide light (Not a cone, sorry)                    
        * Movement mode modifiers are inoperative while riding                 
          (though you can still change your mode, and the display              
          still shows)                                                         
        * Motorcycles are loud. While riding your stealth will be              
          zero, and aggravate=true                                             
* New Item: Ninja climbing claws (Hmm. They don't seem to work yet,            
  though)                                                                      
* Silk gloves --> +1 Chr                                                       
* New Unique: Wong-Fei Hong                                                    
* Wong-Fei Hong and Miyamoto Musashi may now participate in the                
  World Tournament.                                                            
* Added an EMT to the World Tournament                                         
* New Item: Ninja climbing Tabi (These also don't appear to work)              
* Some development of the end-game quests                                      
* Additional development of the Inner Sanctum map                              
* Bugfix: Dragonballs are now properly scattered after use

* Added an experimental retroactive skill system

* Vorpal cuts appear to be happening less frequently than they should          
* Monster hp meters don't register secondary effects by color                  
* Should be possible for damage to knock a character off a motorcycle          
* Why are PASS_ flags ignored?                                                 
* hook(OBJECT_VALUE appears not to be implemented?                             
* Grrr...engine treats wilderness squares differently than dungeons.           
  How do we light them?

#####G(e)Advance Warning Regarding Challenge Quests]                           
                                                                               
  Too much completing for desing time, so it didn't make this release, but     
I'm considering major changes to the Challenge Quests. Too many issues and     
things that just don't make sense. So...the details are still in the air,      
but I'm, thinking something along these lines:                                 
                                                                               
 * Generally make the abilities taught make more sense. Musashi was            
   famous for using paired swords. He should teach the ability. Kickboxing     
   obviously uses both hands. Bob should teach the ability. Etc.               
 * Generally move the CQ ability rewards to regular enrollments. For           
   example, I'm thinking something along the lines of:

Kickboxing                    Double Attack                                    
                                                                               
Again...the details aren't decided yet. I'm not sure what to do about the      
skill system situation yet, either, and the two may integrate somehow. But,    
at the same time I'm not certain there's realy a problem with the skill        
system. You don't *have* to play scummy. Plus, with the Room of Spirit         
and Time, and since the dragonballs can be found multiple times, there are     
effectively an infinite number of skill points and modifiers available over    
the course of the game. Sure, you can fight and save skill points and have a   
miserable early game, and get great results from it...or you can just spend    
points, play and enjoy the game...and then use dragonball wishes to get your   
skills. Again, I'm not sure there's really a problem.                          
                                                                               
But we'll see.                                                                 
                                                                               
Enjoy!
