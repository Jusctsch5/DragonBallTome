   Wow! It's been six months since the last release. I've only spent about     
   two weeks of that time doing any work on Dragonball T, but all the same     
   looking over the change log it's possible this may be the largest release   
   ever. The change log is over twice as long as the log for V0.8.8 anyway.    
   Most of it is bugfixes, but there's some significant new middle-late game   
   material as well. Mostly past character level 35 or so.                     
                                                                               
   Enjoy!

#####BSystems:                                                                 
 * Updated to alpha17                                                          
 * Partial implementation of Party system. Don't even worry about it. It's     
   not ready to be used yet, but this needs to be in place before the          
   Rosshi or Oolong quests are completeable, so it's a step in the right       
   direction.                                                                  
 * Object Theme changes: I have ''finally'' figured out how to generate        
   random objects by flag, and object themes have been very redesigned.        
   Objects should now generally be more appropriate to dungeon location and    
   level. Nakamura will generally not drop Chinese items. Namekians will no    
   longer drop earth items. Ballet and ninja items will no longer be found     
   in Mr Satan's Estate. Additionally, object generate now ''does'' consider   
   dungeon level in generation. Previously, in most dungeons other than the    
   Rabbit Hole you were exactly as likely to find a high-level item on the     
   top level of a dungeon as on the bottom level. ''This is no longer true''.  
   Additionally, for monster drops, the LEVEL of the monster will influence    
   the quality of the items they're capable of carrying. A Level ten monster   
   on dungeon level 1 will generally drop better items than a level 1 monster  
   on the same dungeon level. Consequently, the relative rarity of pretty much 
   everything has changed. Let me know if anything strange turns up.           
                                                                               
#####BNew Material:                                                            
 * New Mega-Dungeon: The Supreme Headquarters of the Red Ribbon Army           
   You thought Muscle Tower was scary? Ha!                                     
 * Five new special levels                                                     
 * Two new quests on planet Namek                                              
 * 30K new dialogue                                                            
 * New AI's: Tenshinhan, Chaozu, leviathan, ai.NAMEK                           
 * New store: Candy store                                                      
 * White Wolf quest has been restored                                          
 * Several new items                                                           
 * A variety of cosmetic changes                                               
                                                                               
#####BRulechanges and Balance:                                                 
 * Damage from bleeding has been cut in half. That still doesn't mean you      
   can expect to simply wait for bleeding to go away. It is still very         
   possible to acquire cuts that will require a thousand hit points to         
   recover from, but it should be slightly more difficult to acquire those     
   230hp/round cuts                                                            
 * Missile Turrets are no longer quite so deadly                               
 * Movement mode Running now:                                                  
   * Pretty much destroys your searching ability                               
   * Halves your natural healing rate                                          
   * Halves any AC bonuses from Dodge                                          
   * Halves any AC bonuses from high dexterity                                 
   * Double any AC penalties from low dexterity                                
 * Kinto Un may no longer appear off-planet by any means short of a dragonball 
   wish. This has many balancing effects.                                      
 * The Nyoi-bo is now special generation only, and only Turtle students receive
   the Nyoi-bo quest. Consequently, while it is still possible, it is extremely
   unlikely for anyone to keep the Nyoi-bo through to the end-game.            
 * Crane once again requires a quest prior to study                            
 * Re-smoothed the xp ladder. It's about the same to level 20, but between 20  
   and 30 you'll feel a big difference. Also, only 12.4 million to level 100,  
   not 15                                                                      
 * Ox King's helmet now grants blindness resistance (theme)

 * A variety of changes have been implemented for Kinto Un, including bugfixes,
   rebalalancing, quest clarifications, and automatic help texts.

 * Outer space is no longer horribly broken                                    
 * Buruma no longer prohibited from appearing once her quest is issued         
 * Yemma now properly transports you to earth upon ressurection

 * Fixed some issues making it impractical to visit the North Kaio             
 * General White no longer presses buttons if he's dead                        
 * Uranai Baba code fixed....''again''                                         
 * Shovels and mouthgaurds no longer allow you to breathe without air          
 * It is once again possible to ride motorcycles                               
 * Mr Satan's reception area now has item decay

 * Fixed a LUA error when running with exactly 10 dexterity                    
 * Never moving monster now never move                                         
 * Updated maps to a17 edge convention

 * Yamcha runaway message now only appears once                                
 * Volcano door weirdnesses have been resolved                                 
 * Issues relating to Kinto-Un have, in theory, all been fixed (Except the     
   infinite Kinto Un bug)                                                      
 * Some of the Chi masters had duplication in their menu keys                  
 * It is no longer possible to get multiple Nyoi-bos, and it is unlikely to    
   keep it to the end-game

#####G(c) Newly observed issues:                                               
 * There is a dialogue sequence that allows you to kill all the Nameks, but    
   still have the Namekian Elders willingly give you the dragonballs.          
 * Battle Jackets do not properly distinguish melee vs. powered combat         
   fighting modes                                                              
 * It is possible to summon infinitely many Kinto Un. There doesn't appear     
   to be any way to abuse this, but it is incorrect                            
 * Artifact display shows ffffff] in front of every artifact for some reason   
 * Walking on RRA SHQ says "There is". After save and load, it gets weird

#####G(d) General Problem Areas                                                
 While this release appears to be mostly devoid of LUA errors and nasty        
 crashes, there are several areas that are very incomplete, and are            
 probably best avoided with 'live' characters being played for real:           
                                                                               
 * Master Rosshi                                                               
 * The Dinner Quest for the Ox King                                            
 * The Turtles                                                                 
 * Kami. Piccolo and the North Kaio                                            
 * Namek                                                                       
                                                                               
 As with all pre-release games, characters may be subject to horrible,         
 permanent death and/or savefile destruction from bugs.                        
                                                                               
 Players wishing to explore these areas may wish to back up their savefiles.
