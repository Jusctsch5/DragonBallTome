  V087 adds tunneling, some intersting ring-out twists, and replaces           
  some things that were missed in V086, but mostly this is a bugfix            
  release.

#####G(c)World Tournament Loss-by-Ringout comments                             
With this release, the dynamic I have always planned for WT-ringouts is now    
pretty much in place. Monsters WILL throw you out of the ring. Deliberately.   
And they do it well. Loss by ring-out is now a major consideration for World   
Tournament strategy. Even a pesky black belt now has a reasonable chance of    
throwing you out if you're not careful and poorly prepared, but some of the    
specialty uniques are REALLY GOOD at throwing you out of the ring. Yawara,     
for instance. Throwing is what she does. She doesn't do enough damage to       
have much chance of seriously hurting even a level 10 character, but I just    
watched her throw my level 22 barehanded fighter out of the ring in under      
ten seconds. And she's not the only one. Lots of monsters throw. Again, it's   
a major consideration for particaptingin the Tournament. So how do you cope?   
Well, if you're fast, you can simply stay away from the ring border. When      
you're thrown, simply run back towards the middle. You may take a couple       
extra blows, but you won't be thrown out. Of course, you have to be able       
to take those extra cople blows. Then there's the easiest way to avoid         
ring-outs: Study sumo and learn Immovability. This will grant you complete     
immunity to throws. But not all players will want to study Sumo, and women     
cannot. Flying is an option. If you're airbourne, even if you're thrown        
"outside" the ring, you're not disqualified unless you hit the ground. But     
learning to fly is not exactly trivial. If you're a student at the right       
school, Dodge skill will reduce an opponents chance to succesfully throw.      
And finally: eliminate undesireable opponents from the lineup. If you find     
and kill a unique...they can't appear in the Tournament. But, of course,       
this isn't always an appealing option either. If you kill Yawara, you can't    
study Judo. And, she's not the only instructor who can throw. So, hopefully    
this should keep things interesting. Enjoy!
