#####G(a)Hello!
This is not an official release. DBT is still very much incomplete,
but I would like to put something out there for people to look
at, to generate interest, do some bug testing, and hopefully,
recruit the aid of someone else who can take a thirty second
look at some of the problems I've been spending hours on, and
simply say 'Oh, just do this.'

~~~~~2
#####G(b)To Submit a Bug Report
If convenient, submit bug reports for Dragonball T on the wiki.
If that's not convenient, please feel welcome to submit them
via email to lordbucket@hotmail.com. If you have the time, you
might read over the fixnotes.txt file to see if the problem you're
having is a known condition, but, honestly I'd rather sort through
a few redundant reports than have bugs go undetected.

~~~~~3
#####G(c)Major Bugs
1) Approximately one in five monsters are mysteriously untargetable.
Which monsters seems to be totally random. It's not always the
same monsters. You might see two wannabe martial artists standing
next to each other in town, with one targetable and the other not.
You can see them on screen. You can attack them. They can attack you.
But, you cant 'l'ook at them, and you can't target them with missile
weapons. (Guns fires arrows, at the moment...if you'd like to test,
and you do seem to be able to hit them by firing directionally, just
no targeting them.) The only clue I have on this is that apparantly
ALL monsters created via Wizard mode are untargetable. But I have no
idea why.

2) Monsters cannot be made to cast spells. Putting spells
in their descriptions causes them to never generate. See
monsters/globa.lua and look up dragonfly for an example of a monster
that never generates.

3) Unreasonable delays: Go to the northeast quadrant of Earth.
There's nothing there. No dunegons, no stores, no fixed monsters.
The map file is fully populated, so we're not even using the
terrain generator, but it still takes four seconds (on my machine)
to load and move to the new map. Why? What's it doing? The same
delay exists in the ToME module, but it is much less. About two
seconds. Granted I'm doing different things with DBT, but I
can't think of anything that would justify an extra two seconds of
waiting. Whatever it is, you see the same delay transitioning from
"wilderness travel" to town mode, and you also see the same delay
when executing town_regen() after staying overnight in your house.
(Though both these are disabled with this release. If you'd like
to re-enable wilderness mode, look at: scripts/dbtstuff.lua)
Also, I notice that working with the ToME module, the delay is
noticeably less when moving from a wilderness-only map square to
another wilderness-only map square, but...if I, for example, (in
ToME) move from the sector 1 south of Bree to the sector 2 south
of Bree, it is only about a second and a half, whereas if I move
from the sector 2 south of Bree to the sector 1 south of Bree, it's
closer to two seconds. My best guess about that is that's from
looking for the map edge information, though it seems odd that it
would take a full half second to pull one line from a file...and
either way, the four seconds that my module is taking to do what
the ToME module is doing in two isn't ok. The first time I tried
to regenerate the town to change a feature, I thought it had
crashed. Four seconds after you create you character...transition
between maps, change a town feature, exit a dungeon...it's
annoying. And, if it continues to get worse as I add more material,
that's going to be a major problem.

#####G(d)Things I don't know how to do:
1) Challenge/World Tournament Quest Transitions

So...we're in a store, and we need to transition to a dungeon.
How? Ideally, I would keep stores as they are...and a player
could press the 'c'hallenge key, receive a cute little message,
press space, then instantly be in a special level to fight.
But: how to break out of the stores routine? And how to do it
in a way that we can continue to exucute commands to teleport
into the spceial level? Next best choice would be to cave.feat
the store entrance into a dungeon entrance, and again, kick the
player out of the store. But...how to perform cave.feat while
inside a store, and again, how to kick the player out? Third
best choice would be to change the quest status, deliver a 
message("Meet me outside!") and then regenerate the town, using
map.quest_symbol to change the store to a dungeon. This would
be annoying for a bunch of reasons: it doesn't make sense,
the four-second delay would kick in twice (once when you exit
the store, and again once you complete the quest), the player
would have to to exit the store manually...it would just be a
mess. 

2) If it possible to have terain features dependant upon functions?
I'd like to alter terrain based on variable DBT is keeping track of,
but I'm only aware of map.symbol and map.quest_symbol. Are there
others?

3) Map wrapping
I'm designing the layout of the "four towns" with the assumption
that I will be able to map-wrap them so when a player walks off
the south edge of the southern portion of town, he appears on
the northerns side of the north part of town. (Would be nice to
eliminate the map-edge too. At the moment i'm planning to do that
by creating a terrain feature that's blank and placing it along
the border of all the towns.) Ideally, I'd capture the keystroke
that moved the player off the map, and teleport them to them
correct location, but I'm not sure how to do that. Next best choice
would be to set up some sort of on_walk hook so that if a player
ever stands on the outside edge of a town map, I think this is
an acceptable solution, but I haven't figured out how to notice
when a player steps on a certain terrain feature. There is an
example of that in the Thieves Lair quest, though, so at least I
know it's possible.

4) Umm...how to make a unique drop a certain item? I see the
example in QUEST_THE_ONE_RING, but...how do make a monster
drop an item rather than force it into the players inventory?

5) Items bought in store have Perma-Missing extra info
I've created some custom flags for the DBT combat system. Start
up wizard mode, and create a weapon. Any weapon. Now, *identify*
it and read the description. You'll see that weapons now have
an innate "difficulty" modifier. Now, go to one of the martial
arts studios, and examine a weapon. No difficulty information.
Enroll in classes and buy the weapon. Try to *identify* it.
You can't. The difficulty information is forever invisible.

6) Various texts are incorrect, and apparantly inaccessible to
a module. For instance: I've changed the currency from gold
to zeni. 'garnets' are now 'a small billfold.' 'mithril' is now
'a credit card.' Etc. All fine and good, but when you pick up
money, you get a message like: "You pick up 50 gold worth of
credit card" instead of: "You pick up a credit card worth
50 dollars." This doesn't exist in desc.lua. Other example of
this sort of problem exist, also...like 'you are on a mud'
and 'There is' always preceeding on_block messages.

~~~~~5
#####G(e)Some Minor Random Things

1) How to make the double spacing in parchments go away? :)
I assume it's a disagreement over how to handle CR/LF's,
but every text editor I've tried generates the same result.
Hopefully I don't have to find a copy of vi for windows. :P

2) I've eliminated the lite and shield slots. Lights and Shields
now go in your hands. (Wouldn't they?) But...lights now no longer
lose fuel over time.

3) Treasure is generating in the Sewers even though the object
theme doesn't allow for it. I'm trying to create money scarcity
for the early game, and being able to scum an easy dungeon to
get money isn't helping. I think treasure generates as a default
if a valid object can't otherwise be found. That's going to have
to change.

~~~~~7
#####G(g)Fixnotes 'todo' list
All of the above is, sadly, only a partial list. But these are
all the things that are really bothering me. Most everything
else I think I know how to do, I just need to get to it. See
fixnotes.txt for the complete 'to do' list.

Enjoy!
