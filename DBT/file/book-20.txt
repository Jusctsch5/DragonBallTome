 This release is primarily a bugfix release is response to the high            
 volume of traffic on the wiki. Keep the feedback coming and I'll keep         
 releasing updates every week or so.

Changes from V076 to V077                                                      
                                                                               
Tuesday, Dec 12, 2006                                                          
* Hack: Temporarily eliminated duplicate dragonball checking                   
        This effectively trades the BIG bug, of more or less being             
        unable to collect the dragonballs for the relatively LITTLE            
        bug of being able to find duplicates of the same dragonball,           
        as well as being able to collect more than seven at a time.            
        So, feel free to throw away, sell and abandon dragonballs              
        to your hearts content. You will ALWAYS be able to find them           
        again.                                                                 
* Added a 'not implemented' level feeling to the Turtles lair                  
* Commented out Splinters dialogue, replaced with 'Implement me'               
* Hack: Added a temporary solution for the store refresh problem               
* Iruka, Buruma and Lunch no longer spawn, so people won't                     
        encounter them and expect them to work properly                        
* Fixed about twenty items that weren't properly appearing in stores           
        SDL version seems to have better error logging                         
* World Tournament disqualification bugfixes/changes:                          
        * Landing a hit with a poisoned weapon now disqualifies you            
        * Attempting to fire a firearm AT ALL during the Tournament            
          disqualifies you. Don't even think about using splash damage         
          from your bazooka to win a round.                                    
        * However, ANYTHING GOES in a battle to the death: Poison, firearms,   
          tools, summoned friends...anything you'd like. (Note: this is        
          fine for the duels with Androids 16 and 17, but may have to be       
          reconsidered for Demon King Piccolo)                                 
        * Except: You may no longer exit the WT building during                
          fights to the death                                                  
        * Monsters are now deleted if you are disqualified. No more            
          running out of the ring and dying anyway. Note that you can          
          still die from secondary effects.                                    
* In theory, you should no longer fight the same Unique multiple times         
        in different Tournament rounds. (Except Mr Satan, who will flake       
        in roughly 2 out of 3 games, then reappear as the final opponent.      
        Just ignore this. The World Tournament should be safe to play,         
        it's just that there's a special storyline branch related to the       
        World Tournament and the final match which hasn't been implemented     
        yet, so for the moment, Mr Satan is *always* your final opponent,      
        even if he shouldn't be able to because he's already flaked on         
        his match.)                                                            
* The WT Backstage Guard can speak again                                       
* The WT Ticket girl no longer generates 'name' errors                         
* Added a placeholder so people may study Kendo                                
* Added help files: command list, abilities descriptions                       
* Adjusted barehanded skill gains from karate/taekwondo                        
* Revamped the schools spoiler and made it current                             
* Oolong:                                                                      
        * Once the village girls have been 'sent away' they no longer          
          spawn in the castle                                                  
        * Marcos now rewards you properly if you kill Oolong                   
        * Castle Oolong is no longer a 'saved' level, so no more storing       
          equipment there.                                                     
        * Oolong quest dialogue no longer re-writes itself to previous         
          quest states if you talk to the village girls a second time          
          after informing Marcos of what's going on                            
        * If you marry Oolong:                                                 
                * He now gives you a ring                                      
                * His castle becomes a home                                    
                                                                               
Wednesday, Dec 13, 2006                                                        
                                                                               
* Afterlife:                                                                   
        * Hunger display no longer appears when dead                           
        * HP are now recalculated instantly upon death                         
* Fixed Imelda's Shoe problem, I think...                                      
* I think I've fixed the Mr. Satan bug with the World Tournament               
* Wishing:                                                                     
        * Fixed a nasty bug which caused certain skills in some cases to       
          be SET to an amount, instead of being INCREMENTED by that amount.    
          Oops.                                                                
        * Implemented some new wish types                                      
        * Here's the big one: Shenron now (generally) asks for confirmation    
          of your wish instead of just making a best guess and granting it     
          blindly. This was sort of a pain, and bloated the wishing script     
          with about 15K of totally redundant code and confirmation texts,     
          but...no longer will you wish for a stealth bomber and have your     
          stealth skill increased. Certain wish types (items, most notably)    
          do not require confirmation.                                         
        * Skill gain wishes are now rounded off. Instead of a 3.617 gain       
          you'll get 3.6. Obviously this does decrease the net value...but     
          it's so much prettier.                                               
* Yawara and Honda no longer drop corpses when you defeat them in a            
  'friendly' match                                                             
* Implemented experience modifiers from weighted clothing                      
* Implemented marriage with Rosshi. (Though Rosshi's dialogue still has a      
  lot of unimplemented branches. If you want to get married, marry Oolong.     
  He's less buggy.)

* Dr. Briefs' store is now a dungeon. This works around the Briefs dialogue    
  overflow error, and allows me to place Tama, as well as some other cute      
  tidbits                                                                      
* Added Tama's Quest :)                                                        
* Adjusted treatment of catnip                                                 
* Implemented the muscle stimulator                                            
                                                                               
Saturday, Dec 16, 2006                                                         
* Updated to alpha12                                                           
* Fixed the skill overage bug (apparantly skill_overage isn't being used       
  anymore)                                                                     
* It is now possible for evil characters to prematurely bring on the           
  arrival on Androids 16 and 17                                                
* Fixed the store dialogue bug (Completely, I *think*)                         
* Started resizing the various dialogues for 24x80 character displays          
* Cleaned up some dialogue dead-ends                                           
* Net about 30K more dialogue since last release                               
* Fixed some bugs with Technomancy                                             
* No more Dragonballs, or item drops in WT matches, either.                    
* Friendly Uniques are now set to the 'Duel' faction for WT matches

* Fixed an absolutely nasty bug that caused Dancers save files to fail to      
  load. :/                                                                     
* Juvinile Playground is now a "decaying" SAVE_LEVEL                           
* Foot Ninja now drop items                                                    
* Yawara may no longer participate in the Tournament if her wrist is broken    
* The Ninjutsu school now sells poison                                         
* Temporarily disabled Rosshi's Kame house (alpha12 bug???)                    
* Some general cleanup of monsters, levels and ai's relating to Dr Gero        
* Migrated a few more special levels to be new alpha12-style decay levels      
* Mai and Shuu can move now                                                    
* Temporarily allowed Shenronto be summoned so long as you have SEVEN          
  dragonballs, whether or not they are seven UNIQUE dragonballs.               
* Fixed a bug that allowed infinite wishes from a single summoning.            
  (Haha! Oops.)

#####G(c)Noteworthy Bugs                                                       
                                                                               
Plese see the wiki: http://www.wiki.t-o-m-e.net for current bug information.   
There are several outstanding bugs. Here are a few I feel are especially       
worthy of mention.                                                             
                                                                               
* Bazookas are broken. If you attempt to fire one, you'll get LUA errors.      
                                                                               
* World Tournament (minor): In 2:3 games, Mr Satan will be allocated as a      
  World Tournament opponent between rounds 16 and 17. He will be a no-show.    
  He will then reappear for the final round. This is not ''as'' incorrect      
  as it probably sounds (monsters ''are'' allowed to flake on matches) but     
  it is nevertheless incorrect.                                                
                                                                               
* Technomancy (major): A nasty error situation can develop in rare, specific   
  circumstances: If you are ever assembling from a recipe that lists two       
  instances of the same ingredient on multiple lines, make certain that you
