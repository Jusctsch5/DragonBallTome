#####G(a)Hello!
This is the second unoffical public release. Like last release,
it is 'mostly stable' but there isn't really enough material
available to really consider it playable.

~~~~~2
#####G(b)To Submit a Bug Report
If convenient, submit bug reports for Dragonball T on the wiki.
I've created a bug report section on the DBT page. That should
be a little easier than navigating the official bug report forum.
If you don't feel comfortable with the Wiki feel welcome to submit
via email to lordbucket@hotmail.com. If you have the time, you
might read over the fixnotes.txt file to see if the problem you're
having is a known condition, but, honestly I'd rather sort through
a few redundant reports than have bugs go undetected.

#####G(c)Noteworthy Changes since Version 0.2.4
1) Several new quests
2) Basic implementation of devices
3) The 'untargetable monster' bug has PARTIALLY gone away. It still
   happens, but only rarely. I'm not sure if that's an improvement.
   I still have no idea why it happens, but the problem diminished
   when I removed the old archery code. If you'd like to reproduce
   the bug, go into wizard mode, and summon eight or nine monsters.
   You'll probably get one or two that can't be targeted.
4) Dr. Gero, robots, and lair added. (Though none of the Gero Quest
   material exists yet.)
5) Several big nasty bugs fixed.
6) Totally new melee combat system. (Only partially implemented.)
7) Various limits have been temporarily imposed to make DBT
   friendlier with the engine (Stats at 99, skills at 50, etc.)

#####G(d)Current Issues
1) Challenge/World Tournament Quest transitions are still not
   correct. At the moment I'm placing staircases via cave_feat
   but the behavior is not quite as intended. For the tournament
   it's not a big deal, but it leaves the challenge quests not
   behaving as intended. They're functional...but not correct.
2) Archery does not exist. I know, I just haven't done it yet.
3) The new melee combat system is not entirely implemented. In
   particular, the charcater sheet display is woefully incomplete.
4) I STILL haven't figured out how to make monsters drop certain
   items. If I don't soon, I'm just going to use drop_near.
5) Perma-missing store info problem continues to exist.
6) Tilde quest info is unreliable. I can't see it with this
   alpha, so I haven't bothered trying to update it.
7) Some display texts are still incorrect
8) None of the combat related help texts or parchments are relevant
   anymore. All the math has changed.

#####G(e)Fixnotes 'todo' list
As with last release, and as for probably the next several more...
this is just a partial list of the more noteworthy issues. For the
complete list, see todo.txt

Enjoy!
