#####G(a)Hello!                                                                
Alpha's 6 and 7 took some getting used to, and this release is                 
mostly a conversion from alpha 5 to 7, but there are some other                
changes as well

#####G(b)Noteworthy Changes since Version 0.6.5                                
0) Changed the version convention. 0.0.1 increments no longer                  
   necesarily mean one day.                                                    
1) Converted to alpha 7.                                                       
2) Abilities are now hidden, and must be earned in game.                       
3) Map wrap has been implemented! Woohoo!                                      
4) Much of the map has been redesigned to accomodate the                       
   wrap feature.                                                               
5) Implemented a system to allow combat mods from equipment                    
   to only apply to certain combat modes. For example, if                      
   you wear a suit of heavy armor that impedes your motion,                    
   it will now negatively affect your melee combat, but it                     
   won't have any effect on your firearms combat.                              
6) Magic pluses from equipment are now counted.                                
7) Some new items and item types.                                              
8) Yamcha's Bridge and related quests have been redesigned.                    
                                                                               
~~~~~3                                                                         
#####G(c)Known Bugs                                                            
1) Dialogue, *sigh*. Yes, there are still dialoge dead                         
   ends. They really needto be fixed, but the dialogue                         
   is altogether about 165K now, so there's a lot to                           
   go through.

#####G(d)To Submit a Bug Report                                                
If convenient, submit bug reports for Dragonball T on the wiki.                
I've created a bug report section on the DBT page. That should                 
be a little easier than navigating the official bug report forum.              
If you don't feel comfortable with the Wiki feel welcome to submit             
via email to lordbucket@hotmail.com.

#####G(e)Fixnotes 'todo' list                                                  
As usual, see fix notes.txt for the complete to do list.
