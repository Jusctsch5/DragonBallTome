This is a moderately sized release. Not a lot of new material, but several     
major systems changes, and a few toys. In general this release is somewhat     
less stable than the previous release, and contains far more bugs, including   
one fatal-crash situation pertaining to screen size (please see 'new bugs'     
for details)                                                                   
                                                                               
But don't let that scare you. It's still quite possible to play up to          
level 40 or so without ever seeing a LUA error. So, sit back, relax...         
                                                                               
...and enjoy!

 * Some AI's have been fixed. Not all.                                         
 * Maximum level and stats are now correctly set to 100

#####G(d)Balance/Rule Changes                                                  
 * You may now study martial arts every 10 levels instead of every 15          
 * Last-level checking for studio enrollment has been eliminated!              
 * A few instant-go-from-level-one-to-level-thirty tricks have been removed    
 * Challenge Quests are TOUGHER than they used to be!

#####G(e)Systems                                                               
 * Technomancy is pretty much done. It is now possible to dismantle items,     
   learn recipes, and build new things from them. There are some 'issues'      
   still. See the 'known bugs' but it's plenty far enough along to play        
   with. Please do.                                                            
 * The World Tournament oponent selection system has been completely           
   reworked. In a nutshell, opponents are now randomized, but it's a bit       
   more complicated than that.                                                 
                                                                               
~~~~~6                                                                         
#####G(f)General Playability Improvements                                      
 * It is now possible to heal companions by 'y' giving them senzu beans.       
                                                                               
~~~~~7                                                                         
#####G(g)Old, Unresolved Bugs                                                  
                                                                               
 * Poisoning display is weird, and not entirely correct. It is, however,       
   only the display text. Poisoning itself seems to work as intended.          
 * AI Swapping doesn't seem to work for certain factions                       
   (Oolong and Pilaf, most notably...compare to Neutral                        
   (or Kami factions, which work properly)                                     
 * Rosshi's dialogue cannot handle characters who are girls                    
 * Lunch's AI temporarily set to NEVER_MOVE                                    
 * check_faction() handling is not yet correct

#####G(h)Fresh, new bugs!                                                      
 * At certain screen sizes, it is possible for in-store dialogue to            
   overflow the available space on the screen. Curiously, this appears to      
   lock the game. Out-of-store dialogue does not have this problem. You're     
   only likely to ever encounter this problem if you play in a window, or      
   if you're playing on an 80 character screen mode.  At present, the only     
   likely culprits for this problem are: George, Akira, Dr. Briefs, and        
   the Widget Factory. If you're playing with a relatively small display       
   you might try to avoid those dialogues.                                     
 * Friendly WT opponents don't properly adjust their AI's for the Tournament   
 * Life/Death handling for the World Tournament is not yet as intended         
 * OOPS! Major, big time Dragonball bug. There is a leak that allows           
   Dragonballs to be permanently, forever, irrecoverably lost. It's not        
   supposed to be like this. You should be able to deliberately throw them     
   away, sell them, leave them in random dungeon levels...anything you want,   
   and still find them again later. This is not yet possible.                  
 * Technomancy: interface isn't very pretty.                                   
 * Technomancy: does not properly 'use up' ingredients                         
 * Technomancy: explosive failure damage is currently irresistable             
 * Technomancy: I have no idea how the system will handle multiple-stacking    
   issues. I simply haven't gotten around to testing it yet.                   
 * Technomancy: There is a particular, if somewhat rare, sequence of           
   of circumstances that can lead to a non-fatal, but somewhat unfortunate     
   error while building items. It relates to the ingredient randomization      
   process. To avoid tripping the bug, any time you see a recipe which has     
   multiple instances of the same ingredient, make sure you have enough of     
   the item in question before attempting to build it.                         
 * In-store dialogue changes unreasonably convey to a player when there        
   are dialogue options that are 'unavailable'                                 
 * Recent skill changes create some balance issues which have not even         
   been looked at, yet. For example, with 11 possible enrollments instead      
   of 7, there are now almost twice as many skill modifier bonuses available,  
   but no other modifier bonuses have been modified. So, for example,          
   Dragonball wishes for skill mods are now relatively about half as           
   valuable as they used to be. Other similar issues may exist.                
 * The enrollment help files are no longer numerically accurate.               
 * There is at present NO WAY to 'I' view detailed object descriptions.        
   This relates to the new inventory subsystem, and presumably will be fixed   
   soon                                                                        
                                                                               
Enjoy!
