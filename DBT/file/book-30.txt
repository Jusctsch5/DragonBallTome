 April 8th, 2007                                                               
                                                                               
 We've been due for a content release for a while, so this is it.              
 Lots of new material. Some of it obvious, some of it not so obvious.          
 We've also gone through a few alphas since the last release, so it's          
 very likely that there are some stability issues. This release feels          
 more stable than V085 (the win.cfg bug seems to have magically vanished)      
 but playing with wizard mode and/or save scummming is recommended.            
                                                                               
 Also, I'd like to mention that Dragonball T has passed the point where        
 I can keep track of everything. It's too big. Opening the dialogue file       
 in Word shows it to be 196 pages. And that's JUST the dialogue. The           
 functions and hooks library is another 100 pages. The quests are another      
 hundred pages. Tools, wishing and schools enrollment...another hundred        
 pages. It just goes on and on. It's neat that it's so large, but at the       
 same time I've been working on this for almost a year now, and I've           
 definitely starting losing momentum. If I had known how much time and         
 effort this was going to be, I'd certainly have started with something        
 less ambitous                                                                 
                                                                               
 I suppose I would find it less frustrating if I was able to spend less        
 time shaking my head, trying to figure out why things don't work. The         
 last three versions have been especially trying, and I've constantly been     
 dealing with problems that defy all sense. It seems like the past few alphas  
 have changed a number of 'unknown somethings' in ways that may ultimately     
 be good for the engine, but have been awfully inconvenient for a module       
 with over 3 megabytes of script written for previous versions. Spending three 
 hours making neat, new things is fun. Spending five hours systematically      
 commenting/deleting from 100K files looking for the one line that causes a    
 fatal crash with no error message isn't nearly as much fun. Engine bugs       
 that appear in one alpha, but can't be reproduced in any other module, but    
 nevertheless magically vanish for no obvious reason with the following alpha  
 also not so much fun. Starting tome ten times in a row, and seeing it         
 crash during character creation five of those times with no error message...  
 very not fun.                                                                 
                                                                               
 So, altogether, I have to admit that this project has been a lot less fun     
 lately than it used to be. I'm not quite ready to stop working on it          
 completely, but it's very likely that releases will start being less large    
 and less frequent than they have been. And...we'll see where it goes from     
 there.

   cosmetic changes have been made throughout the universe.                    
 * The Ballet quest has been redesigned

   * Has picked up a lot of new material: monsters, ai's, special attacks,     
     dungeons, special levels...                                               
   * Entering Muscle Tower might not be as easy as it used to be

Monster Changes:                                                               
 * Several new monster AI's have been added. Some of them are intelligent,     
   and may do things you don't expect: flee from maps, initiate conversations, 
   change tactics depending on location and circumstance, and interact with,   
   or follow other monsters. In particular, some uniques have become deadly    
   nasty, will play shoot and scoot, blind you repeatedly, etc. You have been  
   warned.

 * WARNING: There is a certain new unique, on a certain new special level in   
   a certain dungeon that has 100% immunity to barehanded attacks. This special
   level may very easily be completely skipped...once you know how.

 * Melee attacks delivered while a battle aura is maintained now cause
