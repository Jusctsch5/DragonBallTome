Friday Dec 29, 2006                                                            
* Implementated a 'Story Mode' skill system that uses NO skill modifiers       
  (Chi Masters and Ninjutsu not implemented in story skillmode)                
* Two new barehanded abilities: Blocking, Tameshiware                          
  (Note that barehanded fighters must now learn blocking to gain their ac      
   bonus, and that Tameshiware is not implemented yet.)                        
* Corrected Briefs upgrade quest skill gain text                               
* Added an enrollment spoiler for story mode                                   
* Whoops! Eliminated a double entry for Oolong...could have odd                
  ramifications...                                                             
* Honda may no longer flee from the Sumo ring                                  
* The Nyoi-bo may now be used to thwap monsters at range                       
* Bazookas are basically functional again                                      
* Clarified 'unable to fight florentine' message                               
* Adjusted AC of a whole bunch of monsters. Waiting until level 20 to          
  spend skill points will be more difficult now                                
* Technomancy                                                                  
        * Added the default 20% base construction success rate. (Oops.)        
          Chance to build is now 20 + Construction skill - Item Difficulty     
        * Chance of explosive failure similarly adjusted                       
        * Ingredients are now 'used up' during construction                    
        * Removed debug display info during disassembly                        
* Fixed dragonball drops rates. The following monsters no longer drop          
  dragonballs:                                                                 
        * Space Debris                                                         
        * Children from marriage                                               
        * Monsters with PLANT or ANIMAL flags now default to zero chance       
          to drop (Unique plants and animals can still drop dragonballs)       
        * Mortal/Immortal checking should now be correct. (Immortal beings     
          do not bother with silly little things like dragonballs)             
* Implemented 'special case' alignment handling. For example, killing          
  children, Buddhist monks and starving college students is bad karma.         
* You may now toggle default attack/talk behavior under options '='            
                                                                               
~~~~~4                                                                         
#####G(d)About the new Skill System                                            
                                                                               
At time of character creation you will have a choice of two skill systems.     
'Story' and 'Math'. They're not terribly well named, but 'Math' mode is        
the original skill system you're already used to. Characters who run in        
'Story' mode will notice the following changes:                                
                                                                               
 * Skill points are no longer spent via the 'G'ain screen. Instead, they       
   are spent at the various studios, and you must take a class every time      
   you wish to gain skill. Details are handled differently by each school.     
 * You start wih 5 skill points, and gain 2 per level, thus a potential        
   205 individual class 'enrollments'                                          
 * The enrollment structure and numbers are totally different for Story        
   mode                                                                        
 * There are no skill limits by level                                          
   (Note: Engine still limits all skills to 50!)                               
 * Handling of the Briefs quests, and dragonball wishes for skills is          
   slightly different. In general the gains will be larger.                    
 * Chi Masters are not yet implemented                                         
 * Nor is Ninjutsu                                                             
 * The entire system is a one day hack. There may be bugs. It may need         
   rebalancing.                                                                
 * There is a new spoiler available via help outlining the actual numbers      
   for each class                                                              
                                                                               
Enjoy!
