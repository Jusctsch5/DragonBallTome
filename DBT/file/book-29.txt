#####y If you are running windows, and are experiencing game crashes, delete   
#####y the win.cfg file in .tome/3.0/settings!                                 
                                                                               
                                                                               
I don't know why this happens, but it is new with alpha14.                     
                                                                               
#####y You may need to do this in between EVERY save/load!                     
                                                                               
This crash seems to occur mostly either when creatign characters, or when      
transitioning betwen maps. Consequently, you may load properly, but then       
crash as soon as you go anywhere. Presumably this is a windows-only problem,   
but again, if you experience it, delete win.cfg
