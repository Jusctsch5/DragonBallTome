DVD Notes:
	Sasanishiki sword of Murasaki

Current list of things I just don't know how to do:

	generate a dungeon with no randon items
	get a random sval of a certain tval
	apply a new flag type from equipment to the player
	reference kind info without creating an object
	Empty a store inventory
	set item flags to be only from a list, or of a multipler, e.g: 1000, 2000, 3000 or 4000



Planned for V080:
		Ninja Quests finished
		Afterlife functional
		Freeza/Cell quests done
		Gero/Android/Trunks/TimeTravel quest tree done
		Rosshi and Pilaf done
		(Note: Rosshi sort of requires Videl/Chichi/Buruma/Joesephine...)
		Shredder/Turtle Lair special levels
		Finish Chi abilities!


Planned for V090:
		Babidi/Buu quests

BUGS
	Closing door in Foot Lair LUA error?
	Pilot's Auction setup breaks after 1 year

Fusion Benefits:
Rosshi
Uranai Baba
Tenshinhan
Krillan		Meditate, +20 BH


obj = create_object(item.tval, item.sval)
obj.ego_id[1] = dball.find_ego_idx("designer")
apply_magic(obj, 99, FALSE, true, FALSE)

085-087 issues:
 * Being thrown into a monster should hurt the monster too
 * Disintegration does not destroy walls?
 * Reincarnation is disabled, as for some reason it seems to cause
   horrible, nasty crashes when creating non-reincarnated characters
 * Gah!!! Closed school FEAT messages are causing crashes as well.
   Also disabled.
 * monster_effect.CUT doesn't seem to work?
 * Carriage returns do not display correctly on some quest descriptions
 * Special attack types don't register in monster memory
 * Armor display is weird
 * Verbose descriptions of *ID*'d items sometimes do not display correctly.
   In particular, Technomancers using laptops may have issues.
 * FLAG_PERSISTENT has been removed from the engine, so I've replaced about fifteen
   maps that were using it with SAVE_LEVEL=true. Consequently some WEIRD stuff is
   going to happen in regards to special levels.
 * Knowledge menu has not been DBT'ified
 * Wizard mode cureall no longer restores chi
 * Technomancers really do need to be able to make ego items <sigh>
 * Not possible to have missile ball effects of variable radius
 * "Beam" weapons don't actually "beam"
 * Scopes need to be implemented
 * It is not possible for ammo to specify the ball/bolt/beam type
 * It would be neat to have the chi light effects of evil players radiate red
 * Chi constant effects turn off when chi pool < 1, not <= 0, which is not quite the same


084 issues
If you kill someoneafter they've ben select as a WT opponent, it doesn't work
Honda can't leave hsi ring durign a fatal match
No runnign in Korin tower

083 issues:
New bugs:
* WT 'fatal' matches (such as against the Androids) aren't actually fatal
* It shouldn't be possible to jump over monsters
* Demon King Piccolo handling is generally not correct
* Trunks dialogue is not properly handled if trunks is aggressive
* Light radii from death and battle aura aren't properly cumulative
* Androids 17 and 18 don't kill Dr Gero when they should

082 issues:
* Muscle Stimulators/Sushi not removed from inventory after marrying Videl
* No ego type filtering: Some egos may attach to extremely counterintuitive item types* "Aura" effects from spiked/bladed armor types should be more effective for barehanded fighters with AB_BLOCKING

* Ego flags are being set, NOT added. Thus, strange situations may occur. For example, fur-lined trenchcoats provide less protection from cold than trenchcoats without fur lining. Designer tuxedos offer less of a charisma bonus than regular tuxedos. Etc.                    

* For some reason you can no longer buy things back from the pawnshop :/       

* There should probably be a display indicator for planets that have high gravity
* Chi Constant Effects don't turn off when you run out of Chi                  

* Heaven not behaving as intended                                              

* The alternate stairway out of Mr Satan's training room behaves very strangely                                                                    


079 issues:
* Vorpal cuts appear to be happening less frequently than they should
* Monster hp meters don't register secondary effects by color
* Should be possible for damage to knock a character off a motorcycle
* Why are PASS_ flags ignored?
* Grrr...engine treats wilderness squares differently than dungeons.
  How do we light them?
