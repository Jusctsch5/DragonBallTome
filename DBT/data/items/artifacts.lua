-- Very rare Quest Artifact reward from the Briefs 'win the tournament' quest
-- Yes, this is a massively powerful artifact. However, in order to get it you
-- have to choose a dialgue path which forever excludes you from the Technology
-- skill tree, and the reality is that most uniques in the game do BHAND or
-- CRUSH damage, which this does not protect against. This artifact would make
-- the various RRA quests absolutely trivial, but you have to win the World
-- Tournament to get it, and most characters will probably have already completed
-- most, if not all of the RRA quests by that time. In actual practice, this
-- artifact will probably mostly be useful for weapons fighters who don't have
-- the hit points to finish the final battle with Adjutant Black and Commander
-- Red, but have done everything else up to that point.
