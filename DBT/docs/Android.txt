Android Enhancements are optinal rewards from completing the Gero find-it Quests.
There are 20 possible enhancements, but only 10 possible quests. Which enhancements
become available is random. Once a quest is completed, you are given the name
of the enhancement type before the decision to accept it, but not the exact effects.

In addition to the listed effects, every android enhancement:

	Reduces your total sanity by 2-10
	Has a 50/50 chance of reducing your willpower by 1

If you reach zero sanity, you lose control completely and become a mindless
automaton in service of Dr. gero.
